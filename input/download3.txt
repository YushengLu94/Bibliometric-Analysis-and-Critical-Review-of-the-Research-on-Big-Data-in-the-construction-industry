AB Although energy-efficient building technologies are emerging, a key challenge is how to effectively maintain building energy performance over the evolving lifecycle of the building. Field experience shows that energy savings of 5-30% are typically achievable simply by applying energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging task, not only because the task itself is difficult, but also because the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly, creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD is both time and labor consuming. Secondly, the FDD module typically has its own ad-hoc platform, and the integration of this platform with the existing Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is technically challenging due to the incompatible interoperability. Finally, the information exchange itself is complex due to the existence of multiple functioning modules to make FDD workflow happen. To perform an efficient and effective FDD with the BEMS in buildings, information is needed to flow among an as-built building static information module, a building energy performance simulation module, a building operational data acquisition module and a FDD module. In such a complex process, it is challenging to ensure the information integrity and consistence. In this paper, we propose a Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled information infrastructure for FDD, which streamlines the information exchange process and therefore has the potential to improve the efficiency of similar works in practice. The proposed information infrastructure was deployed and implemented in a real building for a FDD case study. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB There often is a significant difference between predicted (computed) energy performance of buildings and actual measured energy use once buildings are operational. This article reviews literature on this 'performance gap'. It discerns three main types of gap: (1) between first-principle predictions and measurements, (2) between machine learning and measurements, and (3) between predictions and display certificates in legislation. It presents a pilot study that attempts an initial probabilistic probe into the performance gap. Findings from this pilot study are used to identify a number of key issues that need to be addressed within future investigations of the performance gap in general, especially the fact that the performance gap is a function of time and external conditions. The paper concludes that the performance gap can only be bridged by a broad, coordinated approach that combines model validation and verification, improved data collection for predictions, better forecasting, and change of industry practice.

AB In the last decade, building information modelling (BIM) has emerged as one of the most powerful dynamic decision-making tools throughout a project lifecycle, as its encapsulated information synchronises with construction practices. Many reports indicate that BIM has entered the mainstream use in some countries. However, BIM has experienced slow and limited spread adoption in other countries. We propose a comprehensive research model to examine the factors that influence the adoption of BIM. The model draws on technology acceptance model and innovation diffusion theory and is validated using survey data from the construction industry in China. The findings demonstrate that attitude, technological, and organisational dimensions indirectly affect the actual use of BIM through perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU), with PU and PEU being the primary determinants of BIM adoption. Furthermore, a striking finding was the positive influence of the attitude dimension on the actual use of BIM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most BIM (Building Information Modelling) systems serve designers well up until now but will have to evolve toward a more user-centered design, focusing on interactive spaces rather than focusing on digital representation. They are lack of information needed in order to create a virtual environment which can interact with users. Such problems will become more prominent in the case of smart spaces where the environment reacts to users' activity. There are no sufficient tools to design and represent real usage of smart space. Achieving this aim, the paper presents Smart-BIM consisting of smart objects which can react to user activities. The created virtual space with Smart-BIM is different from conventional 3D space. Since the resulted space embodies smart objects with the capability of doing certain functions and reacting toward users interaction according to the property sets of objects. A task-based interaction is proposed to apply Smart BIM in a design process. Smart Design systems help end users to experience their daily activity in a virtual environment and understand the space reactions. It can be used as a toolset to improve communications among users and designers in design processes especially in the design of smart environments. Eventually, it is expected that Smart-BIM will lead to match smart technology usability with users demands. To facilitate further developments of Smart Design systems, a prototyping experiment was done. The prototype application utilizes three typical domestic tasks and several real-time interactions. Scripting the tasks, using smart object managers and using smart home objects make the real-time interactions and system reactions possible. Hence, the prototype gives the opportunity of evaluating users' attitude and expressions toward an interactive and responsive BIM. The results from the first evaluations reveal a positive attitude of users toward the prototype. They also show that when the users can directly execute a task in the virtual model, they can deliver a better comprehension of how smart technologies can be utilized. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this paper is to characterize the competitive positioning of the construction industry companies and evaluate their financial performance. The methodology proposed involves three major stages., The first stage concerns the identification of the competitive positioning of companies within the construction sector. This is achieved using a hierarchical clustering algorithm suitable for large datasets and mixed type variables. The second stage is the analysis of performance of the different clusters. This is done using the Data Envelopment Analysis technique. To characterize in detail the main performance features of each cluster, a decision tree is used to extract the main rules concerning the performance spread within each cluster and the gap between the cluster best practices and the national benchmarks. The third stage concerns the analysis of the strengths, weaknesses and areas of potential improvement for contractors in each competitive positioning. This required the analysis of benchmark companies of each cluster. The methodology proposed was applied for the analysis of performance of all contractors that operate in the Portuguese construction industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents design, development and application of a finite-element based least cost optimisation model (named ResOp) for reservoirs using a Genetic Algorithm. The model makes use of site specific parameters not normally considered at outline design but which are usually available; such as site plan limits, maximum height above ground level and geotechnical conditions.
   The results show that such site based parameters have a significant effect on cost which can be easily incorporated at outline design stage without making expensive changes at the detailed design stage of a project. This would also be suitable when considering a selection of sites. Current cost models in the industry are too basic and should become more site specific.
   The design of a reservoir constructed in Cornwall was compared to an optimised reservoir design using ResOp. The results show a potential for substantial savings to be made. The aspect ratio and shape found reasonable correlation to best practice, but the developed model suggests a more refined optimisation approach which includes site variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Construction project control attempts to obtain real-time as-built schedule information and to eliminate project delays by effectively enhancing dynamic schedule control and management. Suitable platforms for enhancing an as-built schedule visually during the construction phase are necessary and important for general contractors. As the application of building information modeling (BIM) becomes more common, schedule management integrated with the BIM approach becomes essential to enhance visual construction management implementation for the general contractor during the construction phase. To enhance visualization of the updated as-built schedule for the general contractor, this study presents a novel system called the Construction BIM-assisted Schedule Management (ConBIM-SM) system for general contractors in Taiwan. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a web ConBIM-SM system for the general contractor to enhance visual as-built schedule information sharing and efficiency in tracking construction as-built schedule. Finally, the ConBIM-SM system is applied to a case study of a commerce building project in Taiwan to verify its efficacy and demonstrate its effectiveness during the construction phase. The advantages of the ConBIM-SM system lie in improved project control and management efficiency for general contractors, and in providing BIM-assisted as-built schedule tracking and management, to access the most current as-built schedule information through a web browser. The case study results show that the ConBIM-SM system is an effective visual as-built schedule management platform integrated with the BIM approach for general contractors in a construction project.

AB The methodology, Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM), refers to finding the best alternative from all of the feasible alternatives in the presence of multiple, usually conflicting, decision criteria. Nowadays, intelligent buildings' performance that is increasingly evidenced in building design and construction has been analyzed by using MCDM techniques. Intelligent buildings (IBs) are also under assessment according to their IB related characteristics and actual circumstances as a MCDM problem. In this paper, two most known MCDM methodologies, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), are used for intelligent building assessment under fuzzy environment for dealing with the evaluations' uncertainty and imprecision in which the expert's comparisons that are represented as fuzzy numbers. For this aim, three intelligent building alternatives for a business centre in Istanbul are evaluated by using these two fuzzy MCDM methods and the obtained ranking results are compared.

AB This paper addresses those issues relating to the integration of information flows in relation to material management throughout the construction industry supply-chain. Based on a case study, it shows how to bridge any gaps between those information systems used within the design, prefabrication, and on-site construction processes.
   The information requirements of the aforementioned three key processes are analysed regarding an industrialized construction project, and any gaps identified between their three sets of requirements. A theoretical model for information mapping is proposed using these requirements. The solution is then verified through a case study, performed within the operational environment of a construction company. This case study represents one approach for applying the proposed information mapping model, and possible benefits for the industry.
   The information analysis highlights significant distinctions among particular views on the information required for supporting the tasks during the three above-mentioned processes. The main difference lies in the levels of data granularity important for particular tasks. Building Information Modelling based construction (BIM-based construction) proved itself to be an adequate context for bridging the information gaps. BIM-based construction can accommodate the proposed model for information mapping across the processes. Within this context it is possible to separate the identities of physical building elements from those of designed building elements, which is required when mapping.
   This study shows that it is feasible to automate the proposed information mapping in the form of a computer algorithm. It explains the value and necessity of building information model (BIM) usage, in order to provide the context for information mapping. The integration of design, manufacturing, and construction processes, and a transparency of information about material resources across these processes, would bring significant benefits for all stakeholders within the supply-chain. In the case study, the architecture and a prototype of the software system were developed in order to implement the proposed idea. Specifically, the case study showed that the proposed information mapping improved the project's progress monitoring, detailed planning, and management of material flows, across the construction supply-chain.

AB Building information modelling (BIM) can simulate all the authentic information of buildings based on digital technology. In order to explore the application mode and technical approach of BIM in construction management of metro engineering, a demonstration program of 4D simulation management system is developed based on an actual subway station project with Pile-Beam-Arch(PBA) construction method by soft wares of virtual reality. It can not only provide visual simulation management of construction technology, analyze the adverse effects of high risk source, but also realize intelligent interactive control between construction schedule and the 3D model of the station by running the system. Practice proves that the 4D simulation management system provides a new manner for all the management personnel, which is conducive to improve the level of information management in metro engineering so as to further scientific construction management.

AB The paradigm shift in the construction industry from 2D to Building Information Modelling (BIM) presents unforeseen challenges for new entrant construction industries. Experiences from advanced industry users of BIM shape the directions for future use. In Malaysia, BIM maturity is fast appreciating with increasing demand for efficiency and competitive advantages. However, adoption rate encounters resistance from several factors highlighted in previous research: people, process and technology. To improve on Information technology (IT) adoption models factors such as business process re-engineering, computer integrated construction and BIM adoption were considered for this research. This paper represents findings of an ongoing research, presenting the designed questionnaire to access perception of construction industry professionals (Architects, Quantity Surveyors, Engineers and Contractors) knowledge on BIM softwares and BIM attributes. Responses were derived from 120 construction professionals in the pilot phase of the research. The data is analyzed using SPSS for a descriptive overview of the most prominent BIM software usage. Smart PLS was utilized to analyze the path coefficient effects of each variable in the model. The Cronbach Alpha derived fell within an agreeable minimum threshold of above 0.60. The factors loaded appropriately to each variable. The path coefficient revealed people perception had the highest effect on collaborative processes, business process re-engineering (BPR) had the highest effect on BIM adoption and model variance R2 explained 24.6% of BIM adoption. The results will demonstrate the current state of BIM adoption in Malaysian construction industry complimenting current efforts to improve BIM awareness. At this stage, future research focuses on developing the second phase of the model and recommends towards extending and redefining the model with other mediating variables.

AB Relatively little information exists about the use of BIM in the operation and maintenance of buildings. Reported cases of BIM adoption to support facilities management and lifecycle management reveals that the implementation of BIM for FM processes is, in general, limited to an experimental scale. Even large public owners who have been using BIM for managing their construction projects have not implemented it into their FM activities. Therefore, there is little evidence of the benefits of BIM in the operational phase. In addition, the challenges involved in shifting from traditional FM processes to new BIM-based processes are not well known. In this paper we document some of the issues involved in the adoption of BIM in FM and identify some applications, metrics and benefits related to its adoption. The findings are based on a case study carried out within a major re-development project in Manchester, UK. Results indicate a step rise in the level of awareness regarding potential benefits of BIM in FM activities and lifecycle information management.

AB The Iranian construction industry has long been criticized for being inefficient. It has been claimed that 80 percent of all content within the construction process is the same for all projects and there are therefore huge opportunities for improvements. The project manager is essential for the successful delivery of construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to analysis how BIM (Building Information Modelling) can be utilized by project managers as a good tool to simulate project condition to avoid redundant works and waste of time and cost. It was concluded that project managers generally have little knowledge concerning BIM, which makes it hard for them to see its applications. The study revealed that BIM can help project managers in the task of delivering successful projects. BIM a better basis for decisions is provided in comparison with traditional projects.

AB This paper presents a process-based simulation toolkit CST and collaboration platform ProSIM to support planning of construction projects using simulation methods based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and multi-model data exchange approaches. CST uses reference process models for construction activities and addresses data interoperability problems caused by the diversity of available CAD/BIM and project-planning software. The online collaboration platform connects design, planning, construction, and simulation experts together and enables an efficient communication and information sharing. This paper focus mainly on the collaboration and data interoperability aspects of CST and ProSIM in order to enable a wide adopting of simulation methods for planning of construction projects.

AB The building construction stakeholders need to become more proactively involved in making buildings resilient to a wide range of disaster threats (Bosher, 2013). Clients in particular can play a vital role in the resilience of building disaster ( Smart Market 2011). Building Information Modelling (BIM) is seen as a new technology, providing highly accurate information which can help to improve building disaster management. In this article a new conceptual framework will represent the relationship between BIM application benefits and the client organisation maturity levels. This framework will help the clients to fully understand and monitor the BIM benefits in building disaster management. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB Design strategies that account for local microclimatic conditions can reduce the overall energy consumption of buildings over its life. This paper evaluates non-structural retrofit strategies for reducing energy consumption for existing buildings. Based on real-life data on usage statistics of buildings and accounting for local climatic conditions, we validate energy consumption predictions by Sefaira (c) building simulation software. A comparative analysis is then performed for various energy conservation scenarios by estimating energy reduction and payback periods. Our analysis shows that various retrofit strategies can lead to reduction in energy consumption upto 60% with a pay back period of about 9 years.

AB Recent studies have shown that the importance of embodied carbon is growing in relation to assessing the environmental impact of buildings. This paper investigates how designers are looking to tackle this, and the effectiveness of some of the methods chosen. Although a number of commercial and non-commercial organisations are developing in-house tools to calculate embodied carbon, these lack the flexibility to be adopted by a wide range of users as well as the efficiency required to be appealing to designers at the early stages of a design. An alternative to these stand-alone tools is offered through the functionality of Building Information Modelling (BIM) software, which is capable of incorporating embodied carbon assessments as part of the normal design process. The potential of plug-in tools to obtain embodied carbon data from suppliers is an area that remains to be explored further. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a semi-automatic approach for creating a 3D model from point clouds. The proposed approach consists in the development of two successive algorithms. First, the segmentation of the point cloud in geometric primitives is made based on RANSAC paradigm. Then, in a modelling step, the geometric primitives are used for either surface modelling or boundaries extraction and more particularly sectional view extraction. Regarding the results analysis, the developed approach is promising despite some limitations. Not only the limitations, but also potential improvements of our processing chain are discussed. Finally, a bridge towards HBIM is considered.

AB The development of elemental cost planning in the UK gave rise to a generally adopted Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) standard for classifying costs for buildings. The existence of data in this format has underpinned the development of cost control and, recently, the UK government"s cost reduction strategy, which is based on the existence of reliable benchmark data. Similar concepts and classifications have also been developed around the world. Attempts to exchange data with other European countries in the Conseil European des Economistes de la Construction (CEEC) identified some significant differences in national usages for similar concepts (i. e., that in our "common"exchange language of cost per unit area for a building type, neither the costs nor the area were measuring the same thing). This resulted in the CEEC Code of Measurement for Cost Planning, which proposes a common grouping for the building elements and identifies the different area definitions. UNIFORMATII will be mapped to the Code. RICS has undertaken surveys to identify element classifications in other countries and produced Principles of Element Classification for Buildings (International) to promote the concept and use of elements. Until recently, there has been no widespread adoption of these methodologies in civil engineering, despite the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) having produced a Standard Form of Civil Engineering Cost Analysis for use by the UK Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO). The government"s desire for benchmarks has led to a wider interest in consistent cost breakdown structures for civil engineering and the development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is premised on the integration of classification systems used by all parties to the development of a project. The revisions to ISO 12006-2 Building Construction-Organisation of Information About Construction WorksFramework for Classification need to be reviewed in this context

DE Building Information Modelling (BIM); framework; construction industry
AB Currently, construction industry becomes more innovative, competitive and complex, more participants are involved in projects and thus, more integrated collaboration is needed especially during the design phase of the construction life cycle process. Accordingly. the construction industry especially the developing country including Malaysia has been urged to use innovative construction techniques, and to shift from the traditional practice of project delivery to an integrated practice. Unfortunately, most of the current construction project developments especially in Malaysia are still based on the traditional construction process approach; fragmented and separation of the design and construction phase. This fragmented practice has been widely criticised due to the related problems such as reworks, time delay, rising costs, lack of communication and coordination, and wastages. This paper aims to highlight this fragmentation issue and discuss the definition. concept and potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) as an. integrated tool that can minised the issue. Further the discussion of research process on how to develop a framework of BIM implementation in Malaysian will be concluded.

AB Poor facility management has been attributed to lack of coordination and information during the maintenance process. The need for high quality applies not only to construction works and workmanship, but is also for its subsequent coordination and maintenance of a building. The paper aims to improve quality and performance of maintenance by integrating an advanced technology with a managerial approach, namely, building information modelling (BIM) and facility management. A BIM case study was investigated, which was located in Shanghai, China. Five significant areas were identified to improve the quality and performance of facility management, namely, centralized system, visualization, simplification, modifiable system, and smart emergency escape. The results highlight the benefits in applying the integrated system between BIM and facility management. It draws an insightful inference in enhancing quality services in facility management.

DE Traffic Planning; BIM; GIS
ID MANAGEMENT; TRANSPORTATION; FRAMEWORK; LAYOUT
AB Design of localized traffic is a decision-making process for producing the viable solutions of where the parking lots, roads, entrances, exits, and the associated facilities should be built. In a traditional design case, a planner may take into account numerous factors, such as economy, constructability, geological impacts, layout constraints, connection of localized and external traffic, etc., and the process is mainly relied on a master plan and two-dimensional design drawings. Such pattern has certain limitations as these important factors can hardly be overall considered at the same time. It is promising to cope with the issues using a cooperative system where Geographic Information System (GIS) incorporates with Building Information Modelling (BIM). The research aims to optimize and evaluate the site layout for effective traffic planning based on the integrative approach of BIM and GIS. From the case study, the paper also demonstrates: 1) the approach of analyzing the statistical data to represent the existing traffic condition around the building via GIS and 2) the approach of making use of the advanced vehicle simulation models to optimizing the localized traffic facilities design, considering the possible impact of the localized traffic to the ambient traffic. Referring to the cooperative system, the bottlenecks of the initial design of parking facilities are identified, and the corresponding improvements are suggested.

AB The M25 motorway is a dual three-lane motorway and it is subsequently being widened to dual four-lanes in places. Atkins was awarded with M25 LUS scheme which includes 25 bridges in Section2 and 45 bridges in Section5 as well as a number of minor structures. Work includes review of existing structures to confirm that new Concrete Step Barriers (CSB) can be installed on underbridges with any associated changes to traffic loading as carriageway widths widen. The piers at overbridges are also being reviewed to check if they are substandard for collision loads and confirm if they require additional protection, which is then designed. Building Information Modelling (BIM) tool was successfully used in this project to produce 3D models and to identify the service lines that are in conflict with CSB alignment. Using VR model, conflicts were identified and iterations were made to designs. This resulted in safer and buildable designs with better cost and time efficiency by avoiding detection of conflicts during construction.

AB The current manner in which engineering data, especially the structural details of buildings and infrastructure, is managed is highly inefficient and leads to a wide variety of unnecessary costs and risks. The revolution in Building Information Modelling (BIM) has given designers the ability to perform useful technical analysis on lifelike models and representations of a future structure. Consequently, the quantity of information being produced for a typical project, and the cost of producing that information, has increased substantially. This is driving a shift towards better systems of data storage and sharing. It is the contention of this report to demonstrate that structural design is a process which can be largely divided, automated, and outsourced. The conclusion reached is that a Building Information Model, when linked with a Geographical Information System (GIS), could provide enough information to conduct the entire design process. It is upon this basis that a radical new system for the post-construction storage and sharing of BIM is proposed.

AB With the development of information technology, both Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology and lean construction concept became more and more widely applied in the engineering field in our country, meanwhile resulting in their prominent synergies with each other. BIM technology and lean construction concept are designed aimed at reducing wastes, saving costs, increasing productivity, and creating maximum value at the same time. Therefore, it will be more effective on value creation for their collaboration compared to their separate utilization from engineer perspective. This paper reports the combined technique between BIM technology and lean construction concept for its application in the cost management of engineering project of the building throughout the life-cycle among BIM mode, the lean cost analysis and control research. This combined technology is shown to be not only the main characteristic of construction enterprises but also the reference on improvement of production efficiency as well as competitiveness.

AB The tools and work methodologies currently employed in the construction industry do not allow evolution to face up to market demands. There being, in addition, less time for project planning for which more detailed specifications are required and which strive for productive efficiency. In light of this, the development and application of production methods that favour multidisciplinary, integrated and collaborative work between the agents that compose the construction process is essential.
   BIM, Building Information Modelling, technology arises as an answer to the need to integrate all the agents that participate in the process during the different phases of the work. In the present article, a comparative study is carried out between two methods of construction project planning for the real case of a single-family house. This is done by means of the traditional process using computer aided representation, CAD, and a hypothetical integrated process of project planning supported using BIM.
   Thus, conclusions are extracted about the introduction of this technology, reflecting on the experience had. At the same time, recommendations are made for working with this methodology and possible future lines of action. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Completing a project within the planned budget is the bottom-line of construction companies. To achieve this goal, periodic cost estimation is vitally important not only in the planning phase, but also in the execution phase. Due to high uncertainty in operational environment, point estimation of project cost is oftentimes not sufficient to assist the decision-making process. This study utilizes Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), machine learning based interval estimation (MLIE), and Differential Evolution (DE) to establish a novel model for predicting construction project cost. LS-SVM is a supervised learning technique used for regression analysis. MLIE is employed for inference of prediction intervals. Moreover, our model deploys DE in the cross validation process to search for the optimal values of tuning parameters. The newly developed model, named as EAC-LSPIM, yields results consisting of a point estimate coupled with lower and upper prediction limits, at a certain level of confidence, to accentuate uncertainty. Simulation and performance comparison demonstrate that the new model is capable of delivering accurate and reliable forecasting results.

ID DESIGN
AB With the construction industry moving rapidly towards Building Information Modelling (BIM), it is essential that various analysis tools used in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) domain are interoperable with a non-proprietary open BIM schema such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The UK government will be requiring fully-collaborative BIM in all public sector projects by 2016 and is also chasing the target of achieving zero-carbon buildings by 2019. This dual target will require the use of renewable energy analysis tools in the early stages of the building design process and establish the need for these tools to be IFC-compliant. This paper presents a conceptual framework for developing IFC-compliant renewable energy simulation tools using a multi-model concept in which the IFC data model provides partial input data required to run simulation models. A prototype has been developed as a 'proof-of-concept' for an IFC-compliant solar PV simulation tool. The prototype has been validated against other solar PV simulation tools such as PV*Sol, RETScreen (R) and HOMER to provide credibility to the simulation model. The developed conceptual framework is applicable not only to solar PV simulation but other renewable energy simulation models as well, thereby making an IFC-compliant renewable energy modelling tool capable of conducting, energy, carbon emissions and financial analysis.

AB In this paper, we present an Information Extraction (IE) system, which is built from unstructured text based on Computing domain ontology. The IE system comprises four sequential processing steps: preprocessing, topic identifier, building domain specific ontology and extracting information from text corpus. The first two steps perform generic Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning tasks, while the last two phases are application-specific and require a thorough understanding of the application domain. Furthermore, the paper focuses on evaluating the IE IEsystem by selected methods. One of these methods that we introduced here, is comparative. Comparative evaluation performed in this study use of Key Exchange Algorithm with the same corpus to contrast results. Results generated by such experiments show that this IE system outperforms Key Exchange Algorithm, respectably.

AB A novel big data building performance evaluation knowledge processing and mining system utilizing visual analytics is going to be presented in this paper. A large dataset comprised of building information, energy consumption, environmental measurements, human presence and behavior and business processes is going to be exploited for the building performance evaluation. Building performance evaluation is one of the most important factors in engineering that leads to building renovation and construction with low energy consumption and gas emissions in conjunction with comfort, utility and durability. For this purpose, business processes occurring in the building are correlated with the energy consumption and the human flows in the spatiotemporal domain modeling the dynamic behavior of the building. These models lead to the extraction of useful semantic information and the detection of spatiotemporal patterns that are important for the evaluation of the building performance. Furthermore, a number of novel visual analytics techniques allow the end-users to process data in different temporal resolutions and with different temporal filters, assisting them to detect patterns that may be difficult to be detected otherwise. The proposed visual analytics techniques support design and energy management decisions by visualizing the building measurements regarding business and comfort aspects. To do so, the proposed system includes a variety of techniques and components, properly selected to offer quick identification of focal points and evaluation of the building performance. Considering the increasing interest and the green building goals of almost all world governments including EU, the suggested methodology and application could be rendered a very useful tool for the Architecture and Engineering Community working on Building Performance Simulation and Analysis, and all related communities in Architect, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry.

AB Fragmented practices are common in construction industry due to the traditional procurement system and poor adoption of advanced technologies and approaches for construction projects. Building Information Modelling is an emerging technology and able to transform the conventional practice. It can create a collaborative working platform for a project, particularly during the design stage. Therefore, the research aims to improve the conventional design practices by incorporating the BIM technology in addressing the design collaboration for a complex building. A case study was adopted from a complex building in Beijing, China. The data were collected and observed during the design process. A framework was developed to explain the design collaboration process. The findings show the duration of the design has significantly shortened and also improved the design performance in the project. The research renders an important insight into promoting BIM-based design collaboration in the construction industry.

AB The integration and automation of the whole design and implementation process has become a pivotal factor in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) projects, especially regarding recent technological developments and emergent drivers in the field. Extant literature has highlighted a series of recurrent problems in process integration, especially at the conceptual design stage. This study presents the adoption of Generative Building Information Modelling (G-BIM) workspaces as an emerging technology. This has the potential to leverage conceptual design innovation in AEC projects. It builds upon the findings of an initial survey, and proffers a framework for using generative BIM workspaces at the conceptual design stage. This framework highlights the links and dependencies between generative/parametric tools and BIM applications to expedite information transition using generative tools primarily based on neutral BIM standards. Limitations of tools and approaches for providing accurate project information models are also captured in this framework. This paper demonstrates an overview of the G-BIM framework and the developed conceptual tool. Moreover, it reports on the challenges and opportunities associated with existing software applications. Findings reveal that the application of Generative Design (GD) can significantly enhance the design experience by assisting designers in the iterative generation of design alternatives and parameterisation processes. This framework purposefully integrates BIM with GD to enhance the design process at the conceptual design stage. This forms the rubrics for a working prototype which actively engages GD methods into a single dynamic BIM environment the results of which will be presented in later works. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB This paper presents a pilot study attempting to harness the power of Building Information Modelling (BIM), coupled with Level of Development (LOD), for practicing structural engineers to have greater understanding of design decisions on cost, thereby giving greater control of economy. This study aimed to exploit the wealth of BIM built environment data in a framework, matching building material data with cost data, in the Microsoft Excel platform to allow for a raw design cost to be automatically determined. Level of Development (LOD) is a standard which allows for consistent comparisons between BIM models by ensuring each model covers a specified scope. There are multiple LOD's and by applying the framework at each of these, insight can be gained into the design cost over time as it is refined. To achieve the aim of the study, the tool was employed on five separate structures: two blockwork medium-rise buildings and three reinforced concrete high-rise buildings. Results indicate that similar structure types have similar design cost curves when data was standardised. By employing the process over further studies, the empirical curves will be refined with greater certainty, allowing for eventual use as benchmarks to assess economic performance of design solutions.

AB The objective of this paper is to underline the factors influencing the implementation of integrated project delivery (IPD) in public sector construction projects. These factors are broadly classified under legal, organizational and technological categories. Further the role of information modeling to foster the integration in project delivery is discussed. Focus is placed on the aspects/characteristics of information modeling that can contribute to implementation of integrated project delivery. Traditional project delivery methods have been found by researchers as inefficient and litigious. As a result, the construction industry is in a critical need of alternative delivery methods. IPD has emerged as a solution, although its implementation is not without challenges. Therefore factors influencing its implementation should be identified as a step towards its probable use in the future for public-sector construction projects. Owners, particularly the public ones, are apprehensive due to various factors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate these factors and suggest an information modeling approach to overcome the impediments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Governments in Australia are faced with policy implementation that mandates higher energy efficient housing (Foran, Lenzen & Dey 2005). To this effect, the National Construction Code (NCC) 2013 stipulates the minimum energy performance for residential buildings as 114MJ/m(2) per annum or 6 stars on an energy rating scale. Compliance with this minimum is mandatory but there are several methods through which residential buildings can be rated to comply with the deemed to satisfy provisions outlined in the NCC. FirstRate5 is by far the most commonly used simulation software used in Victoria, Australia. Meanwhile, Building Information Modelling (BIM), using software such as ArchiCAD has gained a foothold in the industry. The energy simulation software within ArchiCAD, EcoDesigner, enables the reporting on the energy performance based on BIM elements that contain thermal information. This research is founded on a comparative study between FirstRate5 and EcoDesigner. Three building types were analysed and compared. The comparison finds significant differences between simulations, being, measured areas, thermal loads and potentially serious shortcomings within FirstRate5, that are discussed along with the future potential of a fully BIM-integrated model for energy rating certification in Victoria.

DE Narrative visualisation; infinite computing; information aesthetics;
   gamification; hybrid model of interaction
AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) applications are supported by various modelling tools, being expansive to deliver visualised geometry and databases simultaneously. But there is still a gap in visual communication amongst its professionals. Articulating the advantages of fully Web-based collaboration, this paper looks into how BIM tools make contribution to visual communication between different parties working collaboratively. A hybrid model of low-level and high-level interactions is tentatively conceptualised. Based on the hybridised model, a survey is conducted to elucidate a few experiential matters such as visual aesthetics, cognition and motivational impacts of visualisation in BIM tools. Following the survey, a discussion is oriented towards a new story-telling methodology with a novel term, namely gamification. Seeking motivating and efficient means of visual communication between human-human, human-tool and human-model interactions, the present study focuses on an enhanced legibility and appreciation of tools by those who are involved in BIM projects.

AB In a steel fabrication shop, jobs from different clients and projects are generally processed simultaneously in order to streamline processes, improve resource utilization, and achieve cost-effectiveness in serving multiple concurrent steel-erection sites. Reliable quantity takeoff on each job and accurate estimate of shop fabrication man-hour requirements are crucial to plan and control fabrication operations and resource allocation on the shop floor. Building information modeling (BIM), is intended to integrate multifaceted characteristics of a building facility, but finds its application in structural steel fabrication largely limited to design and drafting. This research focuses on extending BIM's usage further to the planning and control phases in steel fabrication. Using data extracted from BIM-based models, a linear regression model is developed to provide the man-hour requirement estimate for a particular job. Actual data collected from a steel fabrication company was used to train and validate the model.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a process that involves creating, generating, managing and using a digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of building. The use of the term 4D is intended to refer to the fourth dimension: time, i.e. 4D is 3D + schedule (time). The role of 4D BIM is to add a new dimension to 3D CAD or solid modelling-that is, 4D BIM adds a fourth dimension of Time to the 3D Space of CAD solid modelling on computer. In the paper show the project entirely made using 4D BIM (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is an opportunity for real-estate services sector to deliver more accurate, faster and quality building surveys and information models. This paper reports on a study, designed to establish automated procedures for the development of a digital model to assist in faster and better services and delivery of real-estate services by integrating 3D laser scanning and BIM technology. It proposes an intuitive and interactive building model that is easy to query and navigate, and thus support property developers, buyers and sellers in the property sales sector. An outline of the new approach is provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed method to the real-estate services sector. The key arguments in the paper are consolidated by the results of a qualitative study amongst real-estate professionals, which sought to determine the added value of BIM-3D laser scanning in comparison to conventional building surveying and Computer Aided Design (CAD) methods.

AB Substantial impacts through BIM implementation may be achieved throughout all stages of the construction process. The paper measures BIM use throughout the project lifecycle, confirming BIM is most often used in the early stages with progressively less use in the latter stages. This research demonstrates via 92 responses from a sample of BIM users that collaboration aspects produce the highest positive impact. The process aspects are more important than the software technology. BIM necessitates investment in software and training however, smaller practices can afford it. Stakeholder financial benefits are ranked concluding that clients benefit most financially from BIM followed by Facilities Managers. Despite this, over 70% do not provide a 3D model and Cobie dataset at the conclusion of a project. Identification of Key Performance Indicators currently being used for BIM is provided and findings indicate a lack of industry expertise and training providing an opportunity for education providers.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Lately the construction industry has become more interested in designing and constructing environmentally friendly buildings (e.g. sustainable buildings) that can provide both high performance and monetary savings. In general, sustainability integrates the following three related components: (1) environmental, (2) economic, (3) social well-being. Incorporating these components at the conceptual stage is achieved by using sustainable design, through which designers must identify associated materials and systems based on any selected certification (rating) system. The use of building information modelling (BIM) concepts helps engineers design digital models that allow owners to visualize the building before the physical implementation takes place. To apply BIM concepts, designers use tools to create 3D models of buildings where the design materials and systems are selected from the built-in database of these tools. Designers will not be able to quantify the environmental impacts of these materials to support the decisions needed to design sustainable buildings due to the following reasons: (1) a lack of information about the sustainable materials that are stored in the database, (2) a lack of interoperability between the design and analysis tools that enable full life cycle assessments (LCAs) of buildings. This paper presents a methodology that integrates BIM and LCA tools with a database for designing sustainable building projects. The methodology describes the development and implementation of a model that incorporates a database in which information about sustainable materials is stored and linked to a BIM (3D) module along with an LCA module and a certification and cost module. The goal of this model is to simplify the process of creating sustainable designs and to evaluate the environmental impacts (EI) of newly designed buildings at the conceptual stage of their life. An actual building project is presented in order to illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed model.

AB This paper proposes a new model to predict company failure in the construction industry. The model includes three major innovative aspects. The use of strategic variables reflecting the key specificities of construction companies, which are critical to explain company failure. The use of data mining techniques, i.e. support vector machine to predict company failure. The use of two different sampling methods (random undersampling and random oversampling with replacement) to balance class distributions. The model proposed was empirically tested using all Portuguese contractors that operated in 2009. It is concluded that support vector machine, with random oversampling and including strategic variables, is a very robust tool to predict company failure in the context of the construction industry. In particular, this model outperforms the results obtained with logistic regression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Professional, organisational and educational institutions have started to adopt BIM software tools and adapt their existing delivery systems to satisfy evolving market requirements. To enable individuals within these organisations to develop their BIM abilities, it is important to identify the BIM competencies that need to be learned, applied on the job, and measured for the purposes of performance improvement. Expanding upon previous research, this paper focuses on individual BIM competencies, the building blocks of organisational capability. The paper first introduces several taxonomies and conceptual models to clarify how individual competencies may be filtered, classified, and aggregated into a seed competency inventory. Competency items are then fed into a specialised knowledge engine to generate flexible assessment tools, learning modules and process workflows. Finally, the paper discusses the many benefits this competency-based approach brings to industry and academia, and explores future conceptual and tool development efforts to enable industry-wide BIM performance assessment and improvement.

AB In construction industry, cost escalation is a major cause of project failure. The reason is that construction prices fluctuate over time and they are influenced by numerous factors. This study establishes a hybrid intelligence system, named as ELSVM, for modeling construction price variations quantified by the construction cost index (CCI). The proposed method is developed based on the fusion of Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) and Differential Evolution (DE). LS-SVM is used for mining the mapping function between CCI and its causative input factors. Meanwhile, DE is employed to optimize LS-SVM tuning parameters. In this research, a database consisting of 122 historical cases was collected to establish the intelligence system. Based on experimental results, ELSVM can successfully model CCI fluctuations since it has achieved a comparatively low MAPE which is less than 1%. Thus, the proposed system can be a promising tool to assist decision-makers in construction management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The successful globalization of enterprises is predicated on them finding the right balance between retaining the core competitive advantages of home-grown strengths while integrating the best of locally sourced resources and competitive circumstances to leverage those core competencies to maximum strategic effectiveness. Despite the great academic interest that exists in this research area, no comprehensive investigation has been attempted to profile the localization practices of construction enterprises in a foreign context. This deficit is addressed in this study with an investigation of the degree to which foreign firms active in the Chinese construction market have adapted their business activities in response to local circumstances. Five localization parameters are considered: (1)client base, (2)human resources, (3)factor inputs, (4)value chain, and (5)new capability acquisition. Sixty foreign firms active within the Chinese construction market were investigated. Cluster analysis techniques were used to identify generic localization patterns. Five major patterns of foreign firm localization and five minor patterns were generated, which provide a better understanding of localization activities of international construction companies. Clear and strong trends are evident within the 10 localization cluster patterns. The uncovered localization patterns offer important insights to construction industry practitioners, particularly emerging market entrants, in formulating or reviewing their foreign market entry strategies, in addition to significant data against which researchers may explore the validity of extant theories of localization.

AB Existing indoor navigation approaches such as navigation based on 2D geometries and pre-defined routing remain insufficient for many applications such as emergency response, delivery, utility maintenance and facility management. The insufficiencies caused by existing navigation approaches can be overcome by making use of the advanced semantic and geometric information included in intelligent building models. A key example of such models is Building Information Models (BIMs) which contain detailed geometric and semantic information about buildings. In fact, the BIMs' structure is very complex for facilitating navigation. This paper presents a new BIM Oriented Modeling methodology resulting in the definition of a new BIM based model (BO-IDM) dedicated for facilitating indoor navigation. The paper later describes the transformation of information from a standard BIM (IFC) into the new model (BO-IDM). The innovation aspects of BO-IDM can be summarized as follows: (i) it provides highly detailed semantic information for indoor navigation and (ii) it represents the non-geo-referenced structure and complex geometries of BIMs with ISO 19107 compliant representations. Therefore this model is well suited for indoor navigation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Different types of graphs has been successfully used to represent designs at different stages of the design process. Changes to a model representing a design during the process can be modelled by applying graph transformations. In many real life design tasks the changes/updates can be carried out simultaneously on different parts of the design. Hence a model based on graph transformations is coupled with a multiagent paradigm to enable the parallelisation of these transformations to mimic the real life approach. In this paper a hypergraph representation and transformation model is used as a basis for building a multiagent system supporting distribution and adaptation in computer aided design. This representation can be applicable throughout the lifecycle of the design. It is based on research in formal language theory, like graph grammars, and distributed models including multiagent systems. The motivation for the work presented here is given and possible applications are described. The application of the theoretical results in a graph distribution toolkit proposed as a multiagent framework is also considered. To assure the efficiency of the system it should be implemented as a parallel multiagent system. The hypergraph distribution and partial replication, allowing for its parts to be managed by agents, is also presented. The approach is illustrated by a case study from the domain of building design, where it is used to represent, modify and maintain building information. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB What is the contribution of innovation brokers in leveraging research and development (R&D) investment to enhance industry-wide capabilities? The case of the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC CI) is considered in the context of motivating supply chain firms to improve their organizational capabilities in order to acquire, assimilate, transfer and exploit R&D outcomes to their advantage, and to create broader industry and national benefits. A previous audit and analysis has shown an increase in business R&D investment since 2001. The role of the CRC CI in contributing to growth in the absorptive capacity of the Australian construction industry as a whole is illustrated through two programmes: digital modelling/building information modelling (BIM) and construction site safety. Numerous positive outcomes in productivity, quality, improved safety and competitiveness were achieved between 2001 and 2009.

AB The quality of fire and disaster prevention is an important aspect within buildings and architectural structures because it directly affects the life, property, and safety of residents. By combining building fire control and prevention equipment, information and communication technologies, and intelligent building concepts, more secure, comfortable, and convenient residential environments can be provided. For this study, ER Studio, SQL, and Visual Studio were used as tools to create a Web-base "fire-control surveillance, and management system." Fire control equipment was integrated into the building using the building information model (BIM). When a fire detector was triggered, a surveillance monitor could determine whether the warning was accurate and immediately identify information regarding the personnel relevant to the area on fire. Fire-fighters could then determine the fire conditions, as well as the location and types of relevant fire-extinguishing tools through the network. Additionally, they can conduct fire control and rescue operations rapidly and effectively to protect the lives and property of residents.

AB Numerous Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools are well established and potentially beneficial in certain uses. However, issues of adoption and implementation persist, particularly for on-site use of BIM tools in the construction phase. We describe an empirical case-study of the implementation of an innovative 'Site BIM' system on a major hospital construction project. The main contractor on the project developed BIM-enabled tools to allow site workers using mobile tablet personal computers to access design information and to capture work quality and progress data on-site. Accounts show that 'Site BIM', while judged to be successful and actively supporting users, was delivered through an exploratory and emergent development process of informal prototyping. Technical IT skills were adopted into the construction project through personal relationships and arrangements rather than formal processes. Implementation was driven by construction project employees rather than controlled centrally by the corporate IT function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Certifiable management-system standards apply similar management techniques and principles, but each system still tends to have a separate structure in construction companies. Research and practice have demonstrated that management tasks may be duplicated when standards are implemented in parallel. Consequently, integrated management systems are strongly advocated. However, existing literature demonstrates that the integration of planning and control instruments involves a high level of uncertainty. This paper presents an innovative model to enhance the integration of environmental-and health and safety-management systems in construction companies, focusing on the subsystems for identifying, assessing, and operationally controlling environmental aspects and health and safety hazards and using risk as an integrating factor. The findings of this study have direct implications for both designers and contractors because the model helps to explicitly consider on-site environmental impacts and construction-worker safety during the design process and offers on-site guidance to eliminate the remaining impacts and risks or reduce them to acceptable levels. A case study is reported to illustrate the practical use of the proposed model and its benefits. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000579. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Society is becoming increasingly aware of the impact that our lifestyle choices make on energy usage and the environment. As a result, research attention is being directed toward green technology, environmentally-friendly building designs, and smart grids. This paper looks at the user side of sustainability. In particular, it looks at energy consumption in everyday home environments to examine the relationship between behavioral patterns and energy consumption. It first demonstrates how data mining techniques may be used to find patterns and anomalies in smart home-based energy data. Next, it describes a method to correlate home-based activities with electricity usage. Finally, it describes how this information could inform users about their personal energy consumption and to support activities in a more energy-efficient manner. These approaches are validated by using real energy data collected in a set of smart home testbeds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONSTRUCTION; INNOVATIONS; TECHNOLOGY; CHALLENGES; ARCHITECTS; ETHICS
AB Fieldwork in a major construction programme is used to examine what is meant by professionalism where large integrated digital systems are used to design, deliver, and maintain buildings and infrastructure. The increasing professionalization of the client is found to change other professional roles and interactions in project delivery. New technologies for approvals and workflow monitoring are associated with new occupational groups; new kinds of professional accountability; and a greater integration across professional roles. Further conflicts also arise, where occupational groups have different understandings of project deliverables and how they are competently achieved. The preliminary findings are important for an increasing policy focus on shareable data, in order for building owners and operators to improve the cost, value, handover and operation of complex buildings. However, it will also have an impact on wider public decision-making processes, professional autonomy, expertise and interdependence. These findings are considered in relation to extant literatures, which problematize the idea of professionalism; and the shift from drawings to shareable data as deliverables. The implications for ethics in established professions and other occupational groups are discussed; directions are suggested for further scholarship on professionalism in digitally mediated project work to improve practices which will better serve society.

AB Buildings account for almost 40% of the total energy usage and 30% of the total CO2 emissions in Europe. Environmental, legislative and economical drivers require more efficient and accurate energy management of buildings. Current building management systems do not have the capabilities of energy specific monitoring and management. In order to address these issues, in this paper, the Holistic Multi-Dimensional Information Management System will be described with its components: Data Warehouse Core, Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) tool and Information Representation tools. The purpose of the developed system is to store, integrate, analyse complex data sets from multiple data and information sources such as wired/wireless sensing devices (e.g. sensor and meter readings) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) Tools (e.g. Autodesk Revit Architecture and MEP). The developed system is demonstrated and validated in the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) Building located on the campus of National University of Ireland-University College Cork.

ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION
AB Building construction has gone through substantial change with the emerging spread of ICT during last decades. In the field of construction industry, the term intelligent buildings describes facilities equipped with devices and systems that can be remotely controlled and programmed and that are able to communicate and collaborate in order to ensure convenient building environment and effective operation. However, installing devices with such capabilities is only one part of the task of effective facility management and risk management. Facility managers have to be provided with tools that allow them to inspect and analyze gathered building operational data and make decisions to improve building performance. Decision support tools for facility managers usually lack deep integration with building systems. This article aims on technical aspects of providing data from intelligent buildings to the responsible personnel in order to help them to operate the building effectively with emphasis on its energy consumption and risk management.

AB The article describes a specialized building information model implemented in a Matlab environment. It is designed to evaluate the energy efficiency of a building. It is supporting water, heat and electricity as resources consumed during the usage phase of a building.
   The danger of global warming, natural resources depletion and world ecosystem collapse currently is constantly increasing. When this happens 45% of world's energy consumption, 65% of electric power, 40% of raw materials, building industry uses 14% of potable water supply. At the same time this industry provides 35% of all carbon dioxide emissions and almost half of all solid wastes. Therefore sustainability and energy efficiency development for buildings and structures is one of the main problems of modern building industry.

AB The paper illustrates the possibility to move from a bi-dimensional geographic information system (GIS) and a 3D content model to an Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) for conservation and management of built heritage. This three dimensional solution is based on simplified parametric models, suitable for industrial elements and modern architecture, that can useful applied to heritage documentation and management of the data on conservation practices.
   In order to motivate the opportunity in using this 3D object modelling instruments, in the paper were investigated the different bi-dimensional and three-dimensional typologies of representation, with the aim of identifying for each of them eventual lack in data relation, sharing, comparison and interrogation. Some case studies on brick vaults elements analysis show how could be implemented a HBIM for architectonic heritage in order to collect different kind of data on historical building (dimensional, geometrical, thematic, historical and constructive information).

AB Building information modelling (BIM) represents the process of development and use of a computer generated model to simulate the planning, design, construction and operation of a building. The utilisation of building information models has increased in recent years due to their economic benefits in design and construction phases and in building management. BIM has been widely applied in the design and construction of new buildings but rarely in the management of existing ones. The point of creating a BIM model for an existing building is to produce accurate information related to the building, including its physical and functional characteristics, geometry and inner spatial relationships. The case study provides a critical appraisal of the process of both collecting accurate survey data using a terrestrial laser scanner combined with a total station and creating a BIM model as the basis of a digital management model. The case study shows that it is possible to detect and define facade damage by integration of the laser scanning point cloud and the creation of the BIM model. The paper will also give an overview of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), total station surveying, geodetic survey networks and data processing to create a BIM model.

AB Better informed design then allows for a reduction in the use of global resources, to facilitate better siting, geometry, daylighting, function and system implementation in facilities. It allows better optimisation in components and installations placed in those buildings and, in best cases, it makes it possible to generate excess energy to fulfil local needs or even produce a profit.
   However, and due to the fragmentation, the construction industry is only responding slowly. Indeed, clients and contractors are beginning to have an increasing influence. Trust and worthwhile collaboration can be engendered through the visual aspects of modelling and the communicative benefits accruing.

AB This paper proposes a model that captures the factors for the deployment of building information modelling (BIM) that are responsible for business interoperability in the context of collaborative business processes' construction networks. To validate the theoretical model, a case study is presented regarding a construction collaborative network, where a BIM-based office building project will be developed. The Business Interoperability Quotient Measurement Model (BIQMM) uses an interdisciplinary approach to capture the key elements responsible for collaboration performance and BIM platform configuration. Through the quantification of the relevance of each element to the particular collaboration scenario, and with the combination of the BIQMM with a multi-criteria decision-making tool, the analytical network process (ANP) approach, this model enables a quantitative analysis of business interoperability for BIM-based projects, so that an overall interoperability score can be calculated for enhanced performance measurements. The case study presents the application of the BIQMM and ANP and provides a comprehensive framework for interoperability measurement in BIM solution selection. This paper concludes by recognising that relationships between business interoperability and true architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) performance improvements and subsequent economic benefits derived from BIM-based approaches need to be further developed.

AB There is a distinct lack of building design literature specific to the Central Asian region. This perhaps, could be one of reasons for the only slight improvement of new building designs and construction. One does observe the highly glazed buildings are a particularly popular feature here in Astana, as like anywhere else in the world. However, excessively glazed surfaces combined with the weather extremes leads to adverse internal conditions and skyrocketing energy bills. The work presented in this paper is a part of continuing efforts to identify analyze and promote the design of 'low energy, green and sustainable buildings with special reference to the Kazakhstan locality. In the present context, low energy buildings' refers to buildings inherently low energy consuming by careful passive design, utilizing intelligent building technologies to automate building services and minimize wastage of energy and by incorporation of renewable technologies for its energy supply. Demonstration of improved environmental conditions and impact on energy savings will be outlined through a cause study incorporating application of passive design approach and detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for an existing building complex. The results indicated that there is a considerable influence of passive design and orientation on energy efficiency, wind comfort and safety.

AB This study examines fatalities of repair, maintenance, minor alteration, and addition (RMAA) works which occurred in Hong Kong between January 2000 and October 2011. A total of 119 RMAA fatalities were recorded. Particular emphasis was placed on fall from height accidents as they accounted for the vast majority of RMAA fatal accidents for the period. A cluster analysis was conducted on fall from height fatal cases. The cluster analysis clearly identified three groups of fall from height fatalities: (1) bamboo scaffolders aged between 25 and 34 who fell from external wall/facade in the beginning of weekdays; (2) miscellaneous workers aged between 45 and 54 who fell from other/unknown places in the end of weekdays; and (3) manual labour aged between 35 and 44 who fell at floor level/from floor openings in weekends. Unsafe process and improper procedures were the main unsafe condition leading to fatalities whereas safety belt not properly used was the main unsafe action leading to fatalities. Specific safety interventions were recommended for each of these groups to help avoid these fatalities. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although modern surveying technologies such as laser scanning are available, their application may be prohibited by cost and the need for specialist knowledge in all but the largest projects. The paper uses a specific case study, that of a small vernacular building, to illustrate the manner in which affordable and cloud based photogrammetry can be used to record buildings. Much previous work has concentrated on the use of mobile cloud based 3D surveying technology to record small objects, yet this paper illustrates an application within the architectural heritage. Recording the intact built heritage in this way provides a rich data set, and one which can be readily incorporated within mainstream building information modelling packages.

AB Emerging information technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) offer the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry enormous potential to develop collaborative workflows. Cloud computing has similarly gained popularity in the IT service provision for efficient web based data exchange and storage with enormous potential benefits for BIM, resulting in recent calls for their integration. Security and privacy concerns, however, continue to impede wide spread adoption of both technologies. The implication of real and perceived threats on secure collaboration is analysed systematically, towards formulation of a research agenda. It is observed that, secure collaboration threats within the AEC need appropriate characterization in relation to four levels of protective solutions, namely: infrastructure and technical, information partitioning and protection, legal and contractual management and relationship management. This will aid appropriate selection or adoption of the best available cloud technology offerings towards appropriate fit of BIM-cloud integration. Research towards formulation of this agenda is proposed through a high level project-based security or risk assessment framework for BIM-cloud integration and adoption.

ID MANAGEMENT; ISSUES
AB Decisions for building maintenance require integration of various types of information and knowledge created by different members of construction teams such as: maintenance records, work orders, causes and knock-on effects of failures, etc. Failing to capture and use this information/knowledge results in significant costs due to ineffective decisions. Majority of the current building maintenance systems mainly focus on capturing either information or knowledge. This research aims to develop an integrated system to capture information and knowledge of building maintenance operations when/after maintenance is carried out to understand how a building is deteriorating and to support preventive/corrective maintenance decisions. To develop the system, a number of case studies were investigated and interviews were conducted with professionals from different building maintenance departments in public organisations. This methodology helped identify the building maintenance process and the opportunities for knowledge capture and exchange. A taxonomy for building maintenance was then identified which enabled a formal approach for knowledge capture. The proposed system utilises the functions of information modelling techniques and knowledge systems to facilitate full retrieval of information and knowledge for maintenance work. The system consists of two modules: BIM module to capture relevant information and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) module to capture knowledge. The system can help maintenance teams learn from previous experience and trace the full history of a building element and all affected elements by previous maintenance operations. It is concluded that the integrated knowledge-based BIM systems can provide advanced useful functions for construction operations. On the other hand, incorporating Knowledge Management principles embedded in CBR systems with Information Management principles embedded in BIM systems is a way forward for the transformation from 'Building Information Modelling' to 'Building Knowledge Modelling'.

AB This paper presents computational work in building information management, data interoperability, and data population, to support automatic carbon analysis. The goal is to build an effective design support tool to help maintain a carbon perspective during building design, and as such accuracy and ease of use are pertinent objectives. This entails computational capability to automatically manage information flows between different domains and tools and generate useful operative information for design decisions, including 1) processing incomplete building models into well-formed and complete models, 2) integrating and matching data sets of material properties and emission factors, 3) automatic EnergyPlus simulation, and 4) analysis & visualization (post-processing).
   The computational approach in this research attempts to address well-recognized challenges in automating and delivering easy-to-use simulation-based design support tools:
   1. Disparate data sources, ontologies and schemas
   2. Missing data in early design stages required for energy simulation
   By leveraging on existing research in building information modelling, expert systems, and case based reasoning, this paper presents application findings and developments in computational approaches to enable automatic simulation and carbon analysis in a prototypical design support tool. Specifically, prevalent software and information schemas were adapted to work with a split Shared Object Model (SOM) and Domain Object Model (DOM), case-based reasoning and heuristics were developed to facilitate automatic simulation, and the various computational approaches were integrated to deliver an expert system that is fully automatic, and does not deviate from existing industry practices and processes. While the current implementation utilizes a decision tree, the implementation also supports data analytics in completing building models, suspending the need for a priori ontological models.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) has many benefits, and can be used throughout the building lifecycle. At the initial planning stage building performance simulation (BPS) can be used to inform design decisions. Data can be exchanged between BIM and BPS tools using data transfer schemas such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The IFC schema lacks an energy domain, so an extension is proposed which contains energy concepts from a BPS tool called Passive House Planning Package (PHPP). The extended schema was used to create an object oriented tool which facilitates the transfer of data. The process of geometry extraction has been validated with several case studies which are based in Hannover Kronsberg, Germany and Ebbw Vale, Wales.

AB With the construction industry moving rapidly towards Building Information Modelling (BIM), it is essential that various analysis tools used in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) domain are interoperable with a non-proprietary open BIM schema such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). To the authors' knowledge, stand-alone solar PV simulation tools in the market are not BIM compliant. The paper presents a multi-model concept centered on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema linked to a PV simulation model. A tool is developed as a proof-of-concept and validated against other simulation tools to encourage the adoption of solar PV technology in construction projects.

AB In construction, there is a prevalence of application of BIM (Building Information Modelling) involving in the processes and activities to contribute to a better output of lean production within construction projects, but there is still little emphasis on its application during the operation and maintenance stages. This paper proposes to discuss how the use of BIM can capture in use knowledge through the provision of a new information capture and visualisation tools for design, operation and maintenance stages in construction. In order to investigate this, a review of numerous literatures spanning multi-sectors has been undertaken by authors. The paper addresses the issues of uses of knowledge during design, operation and maintenance stages, and BIM's application at those stages and the limitations during its applications. Finally, this paper introduces the concept of information maturity and its form of visualization, through which its use can facilitate a better information management, regarding the generation, capture, use and retrieval of information, as well making optimized decision with provision of reliable, accurate information throughout design, operation and maintenance.

ID CONSTRUCTION
AB Built environment data is of varying nature embedding various forms of sensitivities with potential legal, contractual, intellectual property, and security implications. The paper presents a governance approach for managing multi-actor, multi-discipline, and total lifecycle data, informed by a wide industry consultation conducted in the UK between March and September 2011. The study identifies a number of barriers in engaging with Building Information Modelling (BIM) efforts with a view of facilitating collaboration around a common and integrated project specification. A governance model is proposed that addresses the identified adoption blockers underpinned by a "mixed approach", that factors in various modes of information delivery, ranging from paper-based documents to object-based information conveyed by IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). A demonstrator system is developed and used to validate our BIM governance concepts. Our governance model is discussed in the context of the recent UK government BIM industry consultation document supported by a research and development (R&D) roadmap taking into account current industry structure and its various levels of stakeholders' maturity, capability and readiness.

AB The enormous variety of design systems and data formats utilised by the actors in the building design process has been recognised as a significant challenge for information exchange and project management. The introduction of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data standard as a paradigm shift has opened a first time opportunity for smooth data and information exchange over the full range of design related parameters and processes, reaching beyond the classical constructional, economic and safetyrelated requirements. Moreover, IFC allows for the extension of the standard in further areas, corresponding to the specific design, project or client requirements. These user-driven extensions often close an important gap of the IFC standard and can subsequently be imbedded in new releases of the IFC data standard. This paper is focused on the extension of IFC for the purposes of controlling and managing material use, increasing material efficiency and closing material cycles over the life cycle of a building. Material efficiency is defined by the design scopes of material recyclability, element reusability and waste reduction. The practical implications of the data format extension and design-check performance are examined on the level of the data model and, subsequently, on the level of proprietary Building Information Modelling (BIM) software, based on a pre-defined case.

AB Computer-based tools have changed the focus and modes of design thinking in architecture. While often criticized for its overemphasis on formal expressions and its pursuit of the spectacular, digital creativity has begun to take into account a multiplicity of design factors that define architecture. These factors relate to performance simulation and analysis, constructability, and building information modelling (BIM). This paper discusses the use of physical and digital mock-ups in the context of building technology courses. It uses these mock-ups as an important vehicle that provides students with a feedback mechanism regarding often digitally idealized creative thinking.

DE Building Information Modelling; Tertiary Education; Framework
AB Whilst Building Information Modelling (BIM) is rapidly being acknowledged as a driver for change in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction sector across the globe, the introduction of BIM into graduate and postgraduate teaching programmes in the tertiary sector in New Zealand has been minimal to date. New Zealand has an advanced albeit small economy, and whilst BIM is being deployed increasingly with effect in industry, there is no national BIM education framework and only one tertiary sector institution offers any BIM teaching in New Zealand (NZ). This paper reviews the current approaches to incorporating BIM into degree and certificate programmes in 25 leading international universities, pedagogical approaches and BIM critical success factors. A draft of a BIM educational framework for NZ is proposed based on this review. An approach for further design, development and deployment of the framework is also offered. This paper is intended to initiate debate and to start to build consensus between the academic community and industry on a national BIM educational framework for New Zealand.

AB The construction industry worldwide is moving towards more collaborative working practices, aided by building information modelling (BIM) tools and processes. BIM could be more accurately described as Project Lifecycle Information Management (PLIM). Many firms are claiming to be 'doing BIM', but are just scraping the surface in terms of the benefits that can be leveraged from true integrated, collaborative design and construction. New graduates, trained in collaboration and PLIM techniques will be the best people to drive positive change, but current educational models do not tend to provide these skills. This paper describes current worldwide educational trends in collaborative multidisciplinary education, and a proposed framework to assist academics in implementing changes to AEC curricula.

DE LEED; Green building market; Support Vector Regression
AB Building industry is closely related to current energy and environmental issues. Several green building codes and rating systems addressing the problems have been developed. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system is recognized as one of the effective and widely adopted commercial building standards. LEED buildings were investigated in several green city and green building studies but only used as instances in static matrices. These studies were not able to answer the question why a particular city favors LEED. However, in this paper, three commonly used machine learning algorithms - Linear Regression, Locally Weighted Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) - are compared and SVR is used to investigate, discover and evaluate the variables that could influence LEED building markets in U.S. East Coast cities. Machine learning models are first created and optimized with the features of city geography, demography, economy, higher education and policy. Then SVR model identifies the key factors by dynamic self-training and model-tuning using the dataset. Via optimization, the correlation coefficient between the model's prediction and actual value is 0.79. The result suggests that population and policy can be important factors for developing LEED buildings. It is also interesting that higher education institutions, especially accredited architecture schools could also be driving forces for LEED commercial building markets in East Coast cities.

AB Information about the design and construction of buildings can be structured in a particular way. This is especially correct given the increasing complexity of building product models and the emergence of building information models with project documents linked to them. In addition, engineers usually have distinct information needs. Research shows that engineers working with building information models place particular importance on the understanding of retrieved content before using it or applying it and that exploration of context is essential for this understanding. Both these factors (the nature of engineering content and the information needs of engineers) make general information retrieval techniques for computing relevance and visualizing search results less applicable in civil engineering information retrieval systems. This paper argues that granularity is a fundamental concept that needs to be considered when measuring relevance and visualizing search results in information retrieval systems for repositories of building design and construction content. It is hypothesized that the design of systems with careful regard for granularity would improve engineers' relevance judgment behavior. To test this hypothesis, a prototype system, called CoMem-XML, was developed and evaluated in terms of the time needed for users to find relevant information, the accuracy of their relevance judgment, and their subjective satisfaction with the prototype. A user study was conducted in which test subjects were asked to complete tasks by using various forms of the prototype, to complete a satisfaction questionnaire, and to be interviewed. The findings show that users perform better and are more satisfied when the search result interface of the CoMem-XML system presents only relevant information in context. On the other hand, interfaces that present the retrieved information out of context (i.e., without highlighting its position in the parts hierarchy) are less effective for participants to judge relevance.

AB To support performance-oriented modelling for sustainable building design, one must both model geometric interdependencies in a parametric way and include non-geometric physical, environmental, and economic design reasoning. For this purpose, this paper examines the use of Systems Modelling Language (SysML) to model systems for sustainable building design and develops a method called Parametric Systems Modelling (PSM). Selected diagrams demonstrate the application of the method for performance-oriented building design and show generic models of typical requirements, design structures, internal processes, and item flows of energy and resources in a systems view. An exemplary implementation of a parametric system, which handles the trade-off between investments in both building envelope and heat generation technology, illustrates the use and benefit of systems modelling for decision-making. Further considerations address integrating systems modelling into the CAD/BIM-based design process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many organizations use integrated management systems, which are better known as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. The use of these systems has led to the discussion of methods to evaluate them, taking into account multiple perceptions and evaluation criteria. First, based on a review of the literature regarding the implementation and application of multi-criteria models for the evaluation of ERP systems, a set of ERP system selection criteria and subcriteria is proposed for the application of ERP to companies in the construction industry, because there is a greater need to support the Brazilian civil construction organizations, where there is shortage of this type of system. Subsequently, after the validation of these criteria by a group of information technology (IT) specialists, 79 respondents drawn mainly from the construction industry and IT participated in a field study to examine their perceptions of the importance of these criteria. The study showed that the financial, business and software criteria were most important for the respondents. In addition, the importance of the subcriteria of each criteria group was also presented to assist decision makers when selecting ERP systems. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Design errors can adversely influence project performance and can contribute to failures, accidents, and loss of life. Although there has been a considerable amount of research that has examined design error causation, little is known about design error costs. With increasing emphasis placed on the use of nontraditional forms of procurement methods as a result of various government reports and the advent of Building Information Modelling there is a general perception that design error costs will be significantly less than those projects procured by traditional means. By using a questionnaire survey, estimates for design error costs were obtained from 139 projects. The mean direct and indirect costs for design errors were revealed to be 6.85 and 7.36% of contract value, respectively. Design error costs were found not to significantly vary with procurement method and project type used. Although the research provides invaluable insights into practitioners' perceptions of design errors costs, their actual costs remain relatively unexplored. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000454.

AB The construction industry is one of the main sectors of the U.S. economy that has a major effect on the nation's growth and prosperity. The construction industry's contribution to the nation's economy is, however, impeded by the increasing number of disputes that unfold and oftentimes escalate as projects progress. The majority of construction disputes are resolved in courts unless project contracts call for alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. Despite the numerous advantages offered by the litigation process, the extra financial burdens and additional time required by this process makes litigation less desirable in resolving the disputes of a very dynamic construction industry. It is believed that construction litigation could be reduced or even avoided if parties have a realistic understanding of their actual legal position and the likely outcome of their case. Consequently, researchers in the artificial intelligence field have developed tools and methodologies for modeling judicial reasoning and predicting the outcomes of construction litigation cases. Despite the success of some of these systems, they were not on the basis of detailed analyses of legal concepts that govern litigation outcomes. In an attempt to provide a robust legal decision methodology for the construction industry, this paper develops an automated litigation outcome prediction method for differing site condition (DSC) disputes through machine learning (ML) models. To develop the proposed method, this paper compares the performance of three ML techniques, namely: support vector machines (SVMs), naive Bayes, and rule induction and neural network classifiers (decision trees, boosted decision trees, and the projective adaptive resonance theory). The models were trained and tested using 400 DSC cases filled in the period from 1912 to 2007. Model predictions are on the basis of significant legal factors that govern verdicts in DSC disputes in the construction industry. The third-degree SVM polynomial model performed the best among the nine ML models that were developed, and achieved a prediction precision of 98%. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000148.

DE Textual data milling; Text mining; Post Project Reviews
AB Textual databases are useful sources of information and knowledge and if these are well utilised then issues related to future project management and product or service quality improvement may be resolved. A large part of corporate information, approximately 80%, is available in textual data formats. Text Classification techniques are well known for managing on-line sources of digital documents. The identification of key issues discussed within textual data and their classification into two different classes could help decision makers or knowledge workers to manage their future activities better. This research is relevant for most text based documents and is demonstrated on Post Project Reviews (PPRs) which are valuable source of information and knowledge. The application of textual data mining techniques for discovering useful knowledge and classifying textual data into different classes is a relatively new area of research. The research work presented in this paper is focused on the use of hybrid applications of text mining or textual data mining techniques to classify textual data into two different classes. The research applies clustering techniques at the first stage and Apriori Association Rule Mining at the second stage. The Apriori Association Rule of Mining is applied to generate Multiple Key Term Phrasal Knowledge Sequences (MKTPKS) which are later used for classification. Additionally, studies were made to improve the classification accuracies of the classifiers i.e. C4.5, K-NN, Nave Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The classification accuracies were measured and the results compared with those of a single term based classification model. The methodology proposed could be used to analyse any free formatted textual data and in the current research it has been demonstrated on an industrial dataset consisting of Post Project Reviews (PPRs) collected from the construction industry. The data or information available in these reviews is codified in multiple different formats but in the current research scenario only free formatted text documents are examined. Experiments showed that the performance of classifiers improved through adopting the proposed methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As building energy models become more accurate and numerically efficient, model-based optimization of building design and operation is becoming more practical. The state-of-the-art typically couples an optimizer with a building energy model which tends to be time consuming and often leads to suboptimal results because of the mathematical properties of the energy model. To mitigate this issue, we present an approach that begins by sampling the parameter space of the building model around its baseline. An analytical meta-model is then fit to this data and optimization can be performed using different optimization cost functions or optimization algorithms with very little computational effort. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is also performed to identify the most influential parameters for the optimization. A case study is explored using an EnergyPlus model of an existing building which contains over 1000 parameters. When using a cost function that penalizes thermal comfort and energy, 45% annual energy reduction is achieved while simultaneously increasing thermal comfort by a factor of two. We compare the optimization using the meta-model approach with an approach using the EnergyPlus model integrated with the optimizer on a smaller problem using only seven optimization parameters illustrating good performance.

AB In competitive bidding in the United States, the lowest bid is frequently selected to perform the project. However, the lowest bidder may incur significant cost increases through change orders. For project owners to accurately estimate the actual project cost and to predict the bid that is close to the actual project cost, there is a need for new decision aids to analyze the bid patterns. In this paper, two neural network models, a classification model and a general regression model, were used as a method of selecting the bidder that submits the bid closest to the actual project cost. The empirical results suggest that for selected projects these models selected the bids that are closer to the actual project costs than the lowest bid. The outcome of this study addresses the issue of cost overrun, which is a very common problem in the construction industry. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000386.

DE Building Information Modelling; Interoperability
AB The exchange of design models in the design and construction industry is evolving away from 2-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) and paper towards semantically-rich 3-dimensional digital models. This approach, known as Building Information Modelling (BIM), is anticipated to become the primary means of information exchange between the various parties involved in construction projects. From a technical perspective, the domain represents an interesting study in model-based interoperability, since the models are large and complex, and the industry is one in which collaboration is a vital part of business. In this paper, we present our experiences with issues of model-based interoperability in exchanging building information models between various tools, and in implementing tools which consume BIM models, particularly using the industry standard IFC data modelling format. We report on the successes and challenges in these endeavours, as the industry endeavours to move further towards fully digitised information exchange.

AB The construction documents have not undergone major changes since the middle of the 2th century, however, the technology for producing, managing, publishing and distributing such documents has undergone a number of fundamental changes. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive literature review on the stages of using document management systems in the construction industry.
   While it is widely accepted that document management systems can provide easy access and secure storage for project documents and information, there are a few issues related to using these systems effectively. In this literature review, it is found that there is a lack of document management skills and an absence of well defined document management processes, and there is no established Best Practice or ISO standards for document control and management for the construction industry, etc. The recent development and growing popularity of Building Information Modelling (BIM) also indicates that a new generation of tools for project document management will emerge.
   This research paper summarizes the major issues related to the current status of using document management systems in the construction industry and proposes a research agenda for using BIM to facilitate more efficient project document and information management.

AB In our design company we have prepared in years 2010 and 2011 workshop drawings for steel arch construction of the main span of the new city bridge in Nijmegen in Netherlands. In our paper we want to give basic information about design of the steel arch bridge and present how we have prepared workshop plans for this bridge. Main span over the river Rhine is designed as steel arch bridge with lower deck with span of 285 m. Total weight of steel structure is 6040 tons. Steel structure of the bridge has one arch which is divided at supports into struts which form entry portals. Geometry of the bridge is very complicated because of oblique substructures and curved shape of the deck and arch. In past we have used 3D CAD software (AutoCAD) to prepare geometry of complicated parts of a bridge and then (without associability) we have prepared 2D workshop plans. By bridge in Nijmegen it was for the first time in our design company we have used 3D CAD software NX Siemens to model associatively whole bridge and to extract associatively 2D workshop drawings. Without using fully 3D system it would be very difficult (or quite impossible) to prepare workshop drawings considering workshop camber in all the three directions for such a complicated steel structure. This new approach to workshop plans requires change in thinking of the designer team and requires new specific skills. Big advantage of the new approach is that our 3D model can be used further to support production and erection of the bridge and final client can use 3D model as a base for BIM-model (Building information modelling) of the bridge.

AB Shanghai districts' construction industry competitiveness is evaluated and ranked, based on factor analysis, cluster analysis, neural network and the construction industry statistics of Shanghai statistics yearbook in 2007-2011. The evaluation shows that, there is imbalance in the 18 Shanghai districts' industry scale and output efficiency competitiveness. And the industry in Pudong New Area is far more competitive than the rest of the various districts and counties, which just fits Chinese macroeconomic policies. New countermeasures and suggestions would be established in terms of the characteristics of each district which had been found.

AB This paper looks at current BIM adoption overseas vis-a-vis the Malaysian BIM scenario. Issues in BIM usage to be addressed by the industry are discussed. The benefits of adopting BIM for Quantity Surveyors (QS) are numerous and the strategies to pave the way for its adoption are made known. The broad frameworks for reviewing the foreign BIM codes and standards; assessment of priority research areas and their impact; re-engineering systems and processes in the project chain for BIM are explained. The caveats for implementation are visited to provide a balanced view of IT initiatives. New roles for the QS as cost modellers or value modellers from project inception are envisaged.

AB High resolution remote sensing images generally refer to image to the spatial resolution within 10m aerospace, aviation remote sensing images. The emergence of high-resolution images strengthened the ability to recognize the large scale features, especially for the extraction of houses information in mining area.
   High spatial resolution image has rich delicate texture feature, it is urgent to solution the problem of how to extract the features. The technology is very useful for statistic houses information, village relocation assessment and research of pressure coal status, providing important data basis for village relocation, statistics, assessment. Taking henan as a mining area for example, houses information extraction methods are discussed.
   This paper mainly research contents as followings:
   It is combined with the space texture information of high resolution imaging rich, using different methods to extract building information, including followings:
   First, ordinary image segmentation technology; this method is simple and feasible, but extracted housing information is not accurate.
   Second, the object-oriented method of feature extraction technology, visualization degree and extracting accuracy of this method is higher;
   Third, it has conducted the preliminary height extraction of the houses; according to the solar altitude angles and the shadow of the houses to calculate the height of the houses. And considering the influence of undulating terrain, using the terrain DEM data to analyze study area, finally determined the shadow length, and then used solar altitude angles to calculate houses height.
   Based on the verification, accuracy evaluation results show that houses contour information extraction accuracy is: accuracy of the number and area is over 80%, the total rate of wrong classifications is lower. Houses highly information extraction accuracy is within the 85%. The research methods are effective.

AB Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) is an evaluation scheme which is very popular by decision makers for evaluating their judgments. According to MAUT, the overall evaluation U(x) of an object x is defined as a weighted addition of its evaluation with respect to its relevant value dimensions. The recent years have witnessed a huge concentration and interest in intelligent buildings' performance that is increasingly evidenced in building design and construction. Intelligent buildings (IBs) are also under assessment according to their IB related characteristics and actual circumstances. For this aim, in this paper a fuzzy multiple attribute utility model for intelligent building assessment is proposed and three alternative intelligent buildings for a business center in Istanbul are evaluated.

AB This paper describes an innovative approach to the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and electronic commerce (e-commerce) in a material procurement process for improved design-construction integration. The paper includes the present applications, benefits, limitations and barriers to e-commerce and BIM in material procurement processes, compares the present commercial BIM based and non-BIM based quantity takeoff and cost estimating software, and identifies potential benefits of integrating BIM and e-commerce software solutions for construction quantity takeoff, cost estimating and procurement processes. The authors propose a framework for integrating BIM for quantity takeoff and cost estimating applications with e-commerce solutions for material procurement and supplier performance evaluation. The paper presents a proposed solution to link BIM-derived data with RS Means unit price cost data to generate accurate cost estimating reports, one weight coefficient-based model to evaluate the performance of material suppliers, and a preliminary version of corresponding BIM-based application integrated with e-commerce software system.

AB The construction industry has been identified as one of the most hazardous industries. The risk of construction-related workers is far greater than that in a manufacturing based industry. However, some steps can be taken to reduce worker risk through effective injury prevention strategies. In this article, k-means clustering methodology is employed in specifying the factors related to different worker types and in identifying the patterns of industrial occupational accidents. Accident reports during the period 1998 to 2008 are extracted from case reports of the Northern Region Inspection Office of the Council of Labor Affairs of Taiwan. The results show that the cluster analysis can indicate some patterns of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Inspection plans should be proposed according to the type of construction-related workers. The findings provide a direction for more effective inspection strategies and injury prevention programs.

TI Plane-based registration of construction laser scans with 3D/4D building
   models

DE Construction; Coarse Registration; Laser Scan; Point Cloud; 3D model;
   BIM
AB With the development of building information modelling (BIM) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in the architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, the registration of site laser scans and project 3D (BIM) models in a common coordinate system is becoming critical to effective project control. The co-registration of 3D datasets is normally performed in two steps: coarse registration followed by fine registration. Focusing on the coarse registration, model-scan registration has been well investigated in the past, but it is shown in this article that the context of the AEC/FM industry presents specific (1) constraints that make fully-automated registration very complex and often ill-posed, and (2) advantages that can be leveraged to develop simpler yet effective registration methods.
   This paper thus presents a novel semi-automated plane-based registration system for coarse registration of laser scanned 3D point clouds with project 3D models in the context of the AEC/FM industry. The system is based on the extraction of planes from the laser scanned point cloud and project 3D/4D model. Planes are automatically extracted from the 3D/4D model. For the point cloud data, two methods are investigated. The first one is fully automated, and the second is a semi-automated but effective one-click RANSAC-supported extraction method. In both cases, planes are then manually but intuitively matched by the user. Experiments, which compare the proposed system to software packages commonly used in the AEC/FM industry, demonstrate that at least as good registration quality can be achieved by the proposed system, in a simpler and faster way. It is concluded that, in the AEC/FM context, the proposed plane-based registration system is a compelling alternative to standard point-based registration techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Larsen & Toubro (L& T) -being the largest construction company in India - realizes the importance of being able to offer the best glazing systems to its huge national and international customers. The architects at L& T select glazing systems based on three components: glass type, frame type, and shading. The glass type is chosen based on four sub-criteria: the color, solar heat gain coefficient, visible light transmittance, and U-value.
   As part of a NSF International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project a team of graduate and undergraduate students at a major U.S. university worked with L&T's design engineers at the Center for Excellence and Futuristic Design (CEFD) in conducting all the necessary calculations to determine the annual cooling loads for each of the glass-frame-shading combinations. The goal was to tabulate all the necessary values and calculations into an Excel spread sheet and then develop a simple interface - using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for L&T's architects. The program accesses a hidden database that allows the architects to simply select their desired values for the glass type sub-criteria, frame type, and shading type, and then make a decision about which combination is ideal for their particular building design. The decision is based not just on aesthetics, but energy performance as well as some financial metrics such as additional investment and payback period. This results in a simplified decision-making tool with instantaneous consequence comparisons.
   Through developing this interface, the project team learned the following:
   The culture and dynamics of working at an international company.
   Interacting and working with students from Indian Universities.
   Different aspects and properties of glass and their impact on the heating/cooling loading of a building.
   How to use data mining techniques to turn large data sets into a simple user interface.

AB The process of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is slowly replacing traditional design methods. The use of BIM has been documented to produce many benefits, both on- and off-site. BIM authoring tools create the building model, and this can be further analyzed by downstream applications. Currently, one of the main data transfer schemas, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), contains a domain describing structural analysis, but lacks one describing energy concepts. This paper proposes a methodology for a software independent energy analysis extension. It will be implemented via a system called PassivBIM, which supports the design of Passive Houses using BIM-based models. This implementation supports the design decision making process at both the initial and later stages without having to use methods such as optimization. It also provides an opportunity to design more robust buildings as alternative building elements and climates can be used without the need for multiple building models.

AB We present a novel approach for facilitating fast and comprehensive energy performance assessment during architectural design competitions utilizing Building Information Modelling, an iterative workflow and an integrated environmental performance assessment toolset. In collaboration with all participating architectural offices, the approach is applied in an actual design competition for a high-rise building outside of Zurich. In addition to the assessment of environmental performance, the resulting Building Information Models are used for evaluation of functional zoning, spatial economy and quantity take-offs, thus providing a richer database for competition decision making. The approach was considered beneficial by the participating architects in terms of integration and comprehension of environmental parameters as well as by the project developer for the fast evaluation and validation of environmental and economic performance.

AB The construction industry is gradually increasing its use of structured information and building information modelling. To date, the industry has suffered from the disadvantages of a project-based organizational structure and ad hoc solutions. Furthermore, it is not used to formalizing the flow of information and specifying exactly which objects and properties are needed for each process and which information is produced by the processes. The present study is based on reviewing the existing methodology of Information Delivery Manuals (IDM) from Buildingsmart, which also is also an ISO standard 29481 Part 1; and the Model View Definition (MVD) methodology developed by Buildingsmart and BLIS. The research also includes a review of concrete IDM development projects that have been developed over the last five years. Although the study has identified interest in the IDM methodology in a number of countries, it has also noted that it can be difficult to finalize IDM and make the necessary changes in the relevant software products, change existing processes, and develop a data validation system that verifies that the data delivered is according to the specifications. Based on experiences from the concrete proposals of IDM developed by research institutions and industry partners, the greatest obstacle to full support for construction processes, from an IDM point of view, is not so much documenting the processes and exchange requirements related to the processes, but agreeing on the "to be" processes. The project-based approach is an obstacle to standardized processes and exchange requirements, which are vital elements in the methodology of making IDMs. Several of the proposed IDMs have been developed or sponsored by public clients that have a long-term perspective and the ability to push implementation by setting demands to design teams and contractors.

AB The paper provides background information, extensions and applications of the 'BIM Cube' framework that is defined with three axes: (1) lifecycle, (2) standardization and (3) interoperability, which are related to the practical use and research in building information modelling (BIM). A brief review of related frameworks is given along with BIM Cube's seven requirements for the methodology for the research in BIM and the need to introduce the concept of standpoints. A detailed explanation is provided how the framework was developed and how a 'Systems-Thinking' can further extend the framework with a Systems-of-Systems approach. Finally, we show how the framework can be used to investigate current practices and R&D issues, identify gaps, and streamline research and practical applications in BIM practices, technologies and policies.

AB In early 2009, the design of the prestigious Port House in Antwerp was assigned to Zaha Hadid Architects from London, UK. The project was to be developed in cooperation with the Belgian office Bureau Bouwtechniek as executive architect, together with other partners for structural engineering and service engineering. Leading the actual construction processs as executive architect, Bureau Bouwtechniek (BB) decided to apply an integrated building information modelling (BIM) approach for the complete project and assess to what extent this is a usable and realistic approach for such projects. This paper elaborates on several topics encountered in this construction project. Now, almost three years later, this approach is evaluated and lessons learnt are documented. This article is part of this documentation and aims to present how modelling applications were used by BB in the design and construction process of the Port House.

AB Despite the benefits of as-built building information models for facilities, the generation of these models is laborious due to time-consuming and error-prone process required to compare with as-designed condition manually. Therefore, an automated solution is significantly important for the improvement of the current practice. This study presents a guideline for recognition researchers to address this limitation. The proposed method includes the investigation of common building elements in the IFC data model standard automatically, determination of property ranges of each element experimentally and the acquisition of the properties currently measured by vision data. The obtained data is then used to build a decision tree as a case study. The distinctive properties and their value ranges for common building elements are found out in the conclusion.

AB The unique natures of construction industry, poor understanding and capturing of client's requirement, complicated external factors surrounding, improper communication between temporary teams etc, lead to delays in completions of projects, cost overruns and fierce conflicts among various parties of projects. Effective communication among parties inspires build-up of trust, knowledge transfer, problems-shoot that enables delivery of project on time and with reasonable cost. Hence design information flow efficiently is the foundation for successful construction project. Design Management is becoming increasingly recognized as critical to the success of complex construction projects, in particular at design stage. This paper is an attempt to understand the theoretical underpinnings of design management as suggested in the books, literatures. On the basis of this understanding, the significance of effective information management is exposed. As responding, this paper introduces a concept, namely "Tube map", to assess the maturity of design information, in order to optimize the design decision making. Additionally this paper explains the problems and constraints facing during design management. It also presents and discusses the available tools and techniques for design management. Eventually the paper stressed the necessity on management of construction process, its success replies on the implementation of collaborative design in conjunction with design management process operated by contemporary digital information tool, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), that is a combination of knowledge, experience and acceptance of various parties within the project.

AB The objective of this research is how to convey the results from planning and work preparation to the different parties involved in the construction process. Visualization and representation methods are analysed and characterized, and imported criteria will be identified. The focus is less on foreign language problems than more on the complexity of creating and generating different perspectives on the model. In construction processes even the timing of offering certain information is relevant. This paper applies concepts of modern communication analysis for identifying characteristics of typical information demands in construction. The developed matrix helps to find the optimal channels for communication in construction processes and thus will improve the understanding by all parties. This is especially needed for the establishment of building information modelling (BIM) in construction and its broad acceptance. Otherwise the capability of BIM concepts cannot be activated.

AB The growing application of the BIM (Building Information Modelling) methodology shows that the BIM (Building Information Model) needs some agreed limitations in its universe of discourse in order to remain manageable and to solve the interoperability with other worlds, like the Building Automation System (BAS) modelling. The fast developing domain of energy-efficient design and operation of buildings has put strong pressure on such developments because the vast quantity of information and data models not originally belonging to the AEC/FM domain need to be made interoperable with the BIM model. We propose an interoperability method based on description logic ontology whose core is provided by a Link Model containing rules and constraints, not only to connect dynamically any kind of models, but also to allow sound quality control of the links by supporting knowledge-based management methods protecting the end-user from possible errors by the exponentially growing possible links with the increase of the level of needed detail.

DE Building Information Modelling (BIM); BIM Execution Plan (BEP);
   Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM); Multi Domain Matrix (MDM)
AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) Execution Plan (BEP) is a complex process model used to represent the lifecycle process in modern building projects. The complexity is caused by the system of concurrent processes involved that are interdependent by means of information exchange requirements in the form of intermediate models and other information. Process oriented BEPs set the baseline for developing process maps which gives a visual representation of the interrelationships between and sequence of processes. But, there are different levels of details possible for processes and when details are more, process maps consumes enormous space making it unfeasible. This paper discusses various levels of details in which the BIM processes can be represented and demonstrates the application of Multi Domain Matrix (MDM) along with process maps. Analysis of MDM reveals more about the process architecture than visualisation in the process maps.

DE Building information modelling; industry foundation classes;
   interoperability
AB Nowadays, the BIM (Building Information Modelling) paradigm is a central topic in the CAAD community. Next to the commercial solutions, the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) have emerged as the best open standard candidate for BIM interoperability. Despite the efforts of the community for promoting IFC over the last 15 years, it seems that its practical adoption in real-life projects has been very limited. The goal of this article is to explore how useful IFC can be today and to provide the reader with some advice for an effective adoption of IFC. Over the last year, we have conducted a project aiming at acquiring a sound understanding of IFC. It was made of two complementary investigations. On one hand, we have focused on the commercial modelling tools and the IFC support they were offering. On the other hand, we have focused on the IFC-based software developments. We have developed a tool converting IFC files into a dedicated thermal assessment based model. We will summarise the experience we have acquired in this project into some advice for users migrating to IFC. Our goal is to confront the practical aspects of the IFC developments, with both the theoretical ambitions and the commercial support currently available.

DE Building information model; parametric modelling; generative modelling
AB Parametric and generative modelling methods are ways in which computer models are made more flexible, and of formalising domain-specific knowledge. At present, no open standard exists for the interchange of parametric and generative information. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which are an open standard for interoperability in building information models is presented as the base for an open standard in parametric modelling. The advantage of allowing parametric and generative representations are that the early design process can allow for more iteration and changes can be implemented quicker than with traditional models. This paper begins with a formal definition of what constitutes to be parametric and generative modelling methods and then proceeds to describe an open standard in which the interchange of components could be implemented. As an illustrative example of generative design, Frazer's 'Reptiles' project from 1968 is reinterpreted.

AB In this study we develop an automatic detection model for discovering erroneous tax reports. The model uses a variety of neural network applications inclusive of the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), decision tree, and Hyper-Rectangular Composite Neural Network (HRCNN) methods. Detailed taxation information from construction companies registered in the northern Taiwan region is sampled, giving a total of 5769 tax reports from 3172 construction companies which make up 35.98% of the top-three-class construction companies. The results confirm that the model yields a better recognition rate for distinguishing erroneous tax reports from the others. The automatic model is thus proven feasible for detecting erroneous tax reports. In addition, we note that the HRCNN yields a correction rate of 78% and, furthermore, generates 248 valuable rules, providing construction practitioners with criteria for preventing the submission of erroneous tax reports.

AB Embodied carbon dioxide is increasingly being used to measure the sustainability of a building's structure. With reference to the West Kowloon terminus in Hong Kong, this paper outlines how estimates of embodied carbon dioxide were used as a design tool to develop structural options, and how embodied carbon dioxide data were incorporated within building information modelling processes. It proposes that embodied-carbon accounting be used alongside quantity surveying to determine the out-turn cost of a building, and recommends clients estimate embodied carbon dioxide on recently completed projects to help establish benchmarks.

AB Two critical decisions faced by bidders in competitive bidding include, firstly, whether or not to submit a bid, and secondly (if the answer to the first is 'yes') what markup value should be used on the submitted bid. In the construction industry, government agencies and private sector clients typically adopt competitive bidding to determine contract awards. Contractors also apply the same approach to bidding decisions. There are many variables that affect contractor decisions regarding whether to bid and the markup scale, which complicate the bidding decision process. This study proposes a Multi-Criteria Prospect Model for Bidding Decision (BD-MCPM) to assist contractors to make decisions on bid/no bid and markup scale. Key factors of influence that impact bidding decisions were identified first. Second, Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPR) was employed to assess factor weights and determine bid/no bid. Finally, if a decision to bid is given, then the Multi-Criteria Prospect Model (MCPM), which links Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPR) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), is deployed to determine the markup scale that best conforms to primary decision maker (PDM) preferences. The applicability of this model was demonstrated in a real case study.

TI A semantic rule checking environment for building performance checking
SO AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Semantic web; Construction industry; Rule checking; Reasoning
AB Today's construction industry relies heavily on high-performing building information modelling (BIM) systems. By deploying the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a description language, these systems offer building information in a widely interoperable format, so that several applications are able to infer extra information. For a certain functionality, IFC shows limitations however. Existing semantic web technology may be able to overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building design and construction. An implemented test case for acoustic performance checking illustrates the improvements of such an environment compared to traditionally deployed approaches in rule checking. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents our findings of current applications of computer games in design visualization and education, and our solution to address interoperability between games and building models to enhance architectural visualization and education. We demonstrate our BIM-Game prototype that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) and gaming into architectural visualization. Our system supports an innovative Design-Play process that allows designers to play in their own designed environments with the capability for simulations of physical dynamics and user activities. The implementation of this BIM-Game provides a variety of connections among several fields including architecture, engineering, computer science, visualization, and game development. These connections bridge diverse areas such as building modelling, equipment simulation and visualization, character modelling and animation, collision detection, navigation, path planning, materials and lighting, and interaction through game controllers and user interfaces. The paper presents a framework for integrating BIM and games, and a sample experiment of real-time, interactive, and photorealistic walkthrough with a virtual user model to demonstrate the use and the potentials of the framework. We expect this research to extend the study and adaptability of computer games in design education. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Safety education is a basic method for protecting workers from danger in the construction field, and is an important measure that can be efficiently used without any limitation for disaster prevention. However, safety education in the construction field is only provided for the education's sake and is boring for the workers. Reasons for boredom are that the education does not consider individual characteristics and the education content is not related to individuals, and so cannot lead to the active participation of workers. Our analysis develops a framework that is available for use in the construction industry and suited to workers. We use quantitative analysis of individuals and groups, and models are derived through technical statistics, cross analysis, multinominal logistic analysis, and cluster analysis. The resulting approach is considered the best that can be applied in the construction field. Finally, possible future extensions are indicated.

AB In this paper, data mining techniques are coupled with internal daylight analytical tools. The aim is to examine the benefits of these techniques in assisting designers' decision making and improving scalability and applicability of indoor daylight methods. Techniques were verified using lowest annual daylight factor values, resulting from the worst case scenario in Ecotect, for rooms in the Environmental Research Institute building, Ireland. These values were used, along with real time hourly environmental conditions, sampled at 15 min intervals, during working hours, over 3 years, for the development of several prediction models. Results show that techniques perform better than individual analytical tools. Attribute importance models bring out essential building characteristics required to estimate performance for optimized room and building design. The number of simulation prototypes is reduced and need for sensing equipment is eliminated to determine indoor daylight levels by regression analysis. Acceleration of the assessment of building performance using different daylight design criteria can be observed by the use of classification modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study provides a review of important issues for 'Building Information Modelling' (BIM) tools and standards and comprehensive recommendations for their advancement and development that may improve BIM technologies and provide a basis for inter-operability, integration, model-based communication, and collaboration in building projects.
   Based on a critical review of Building Product Modelling, including the development of standards for exchange and the features of over 150 AEC/O (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) tools and digital models, a methodological framework is proposed for improvements to both BIM tools and schemata. The features relevant to the framework were studied using a conceptual process model and a 'BIM System-of-Systems' (BIM-SoS) model. The development, implementation, and use of the BIM Schema are analysed from the standpoint of standardisation.
   The results embrace the requirements for a BIM research methodology, with an example of methods and procedures, an R&D review with critique, and a multi-standpoint framework for developments with concrete recommendations, supported by BIM metrics, upon which the progress of tools, models, and standards may be measured, evaluated, streamlined, and judged. It is also proposed that any BIM Schema will never be 'completed' but should be developed as evolutionary ontology by 'segmented standpoint models' to better account for evolving tools and AEC/O practices.

AB Recent advances in building information modelling (BIM) have disseminated the utilization of multidimensional (nD) CAD information in the construction industry. Nevertheless, the overall and practical effectiveness of BIM utilization is difficult to justify at this stage. The purpose of this paper is to propose a BIM framework focusing on the issues of practicability for real-world projects. Even though previous efforts in the BIM framework have properly addressed the BIM variables, comprehensive issues in terms of BIM effectiveness need to be further developed. A thorough literature review of computer-integrated construction (CIC) and BIM was performed first in order to interpret the BIM from a global perspective. A comprehensive BIM framework consisting of three dimensions and six categories was then developed to address the variables for theory and implementation. This framework can provide a basis for evaluating promising areas and identifying driving factors for practical BIM effectiveness. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most complex projects in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries involve multi-disciplinary collaboration and the exchange of large building data set. Traditionally, the collaboration efforts across the disciplines have been based on the frequent exchange of 2D drawings and documents. However, during the past decade, the widespread adoption of object-oriented Computer-aided Design (CAD) tools has generated more interests in Building Information Modelling (BIM). A number of BIM-compliant applications such as analysis tools, model checkers and facility management applications are being developed. This paper develops a theoretical framework of technical requirements for using BIM-server as a multi-disciplinary collaboration platform. The methodologies that are used to develop the framework include focus group interviews (FGIs) with representatives from the diverse AEC disciplines, a case study of an Architectural project using a state-of-the-art BIM-server, and a critical review and analysis of current collaboration platforms that are available to the AEC industries. This paper concludes that greater emphasis should be placed on supporting technical requirements to facilitate technology management and implementation across disciplines. Their implications for user-centric technology development in design and construction industry are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) refers to models of geometry of a facility to be designed and built. The goal of the BIM development process is to build an error-free model in an efficient way. The use of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycles has proven successful for adapting the BIM development process to the needs off the project, thus avoiding rework during development of the model. Integrated modelling of conflicts between building components (often called 'clashes'), the BIM development process, and the organizational structure of the development team with the Multiple Domain Matrix (MDM) enabled deduction of planned and actual communication flows in the organization. The two perspectives of communication were compared as part of 'Check' in the PDCA cycle. Comparison identified problems in the BIM development process, which were the starting point for root cause analysis.

AB This paper proposes an automated method for monitoring changes of 3D building elements using unordered photo collections as well as Building Information Models (BIM) that pertain information about geometry and relationships of elements. This task is particularly challenging as existing construction photographs are taken under different lighting and viewpoint conditions, are uncalibrated and extremely cluttered by equipment and people. Given a set of these images, our system first uses structure-from-motion, multi-view stereo, and voxel coloring algorithms to calibrate cameras, reconstruct the construction scene, quantize the scene into voxels and traverse and label the voxels for observed occupancy. The BIM is subsequently fused into the observed scene by a registration-step and voxels are traversed and labeled for expected visibility. Next, a machine learning scheme built upon a Bayesian model is proposed that automatically detects and tracks building elements in presence of occlusions. Finally, the system enables the expected and reconstructed elements to be explored with an interactive, image-based 3D viewer where construction progress deviations are automatically color-coded over the BIM. We present promising results on several challenging construction photo collections under different lighting conditions and sever occlusions.

DE Trust; Risk; Collaboration & Metadata
AB Many commentators and analysts are now saying that we are reaching the tipping moment in the adoption of building information modelling. By this they mean that the uphill struggle for implementation is finally falling into place and that it is beginning to gather its own momentum. This is to be welcomed.
   But the construction industry is very fragmented and how implementation can be accomplished is appearing sluggish. Certain drivers like owners and developers are beginning to have an impact while others like architects and planners remain somewhat listless.
   How to manage this risk, engender trust and make worthwhile collaboration can be helped with rated 'levels of detail' and calibrated 'metadata'.

AB Incorporating energy efficiency and sustainable green design features into new/existing buildings has become a top priority in recent years for building owners, designers, contractors, and facility managers. This paper intends to address why delivery of an energy efficient building is not just the result of applying one or more isolated technologies. Rather, it can best be obtained using an integrated whole building process throughout the entire project development process, which leads building designers to generate a large amount of data during energy simulations. The authors observed that even a simple energy modeling run generated pages of data with many different variables. The volumes of energy modeling data clearly overwhelm traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries with so many factors to be considered. An integrated or whole building design process involves studies of the energy-related impacts and interactions of all building components, including the building location, envelope (walls, windows, doors, and roof), heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, lighting, controls, and equipment, which shows why it is so difficult to find the correlation between different systems. The objective of this research is to develop an energy efficient building design process using data mining technology which can help project teams discover important patterns to improve the building design. This paper utilizes the data mining technology to extract interrelationships and patterns of interest from a large dataset Case study revealed that data mining based energy modeling help project teams discover useful patterns to improve the energy efficiency of building design during the design phase. The method developed during this research could be used to guide designers and engineers through the process of completing an early design energy analysis based on energy simulation models.

DE Building information modelling; information behaviour; communication;

AB Building Information Modeling (BIM) is in use today and is flourishing in Architecture Engineering-Construction (AEC) industry. However, the lack of agreement pertaining to the definition and the framework of BIM has stifled its adoption. What is more, how BIM functions during the information communication process has not attracted the expected level of attention, especially from the perspectives of information behavior and communication. The AEC industry and the research community need a systematic model that helps them better understand BIM and its function as a communication platform or processor. Three steps are conducted to fill this gap. Based on Hall's three-dimensional. morphology of system engineering, a framework of BIM is proposed from the three perspectives of time, logic and profession. Each perspective is further reduced to. detailed components and indexes. In order to study how BIM functions during the information communication process, an information behavior model of a communication system is proposed by integrating and developing models of system, communication and information behavior. Finally, the importance and limitations of the research are discussed. The research thus promotes a common understanding of BIM and its function during the information communication process.

AB This paper serves as a case study on the economic and environmental sustainability of new buildings, in particular referring to five of the major Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Building Automation System (BAS) projects either designed and/or project managed by Electrical Engineering Solutions (EES), for the Soccer World Cup 2010 hosted in South Africa.
   To understand sustainability of new buildings, it is useful to know what the threats to sustainability are, and these are discussed in the context of the five projects below. Going forward, a "sustainability ideology" should be key for developers and other stakeholders. ICT and BAS professionals must engage with architects and construction consultants at an early stage to ensure that the required infrastructure facilities are incorporated in the architectural design.. Furthermore the ICT industry needs to educate and up-skill the built environment delivery sector on a continuous basis, at both student and professional levels.
   In general, it can be shown that an intelligent building design team interacts to set energy performance goals, manage the building system's interdependencies and produce a more efficient, cost-effective, smarter building.
   The implementation of a smart building design is usually best delivered by a master systems integrator (MSI).

DE Building Information Modelling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC);
   parameter-based Design Structure Matrix (DSM)
AB Design process is complex in collaborative environments having large team size and many disciplines. Building design also has become sophisticated and schedules have been tightened. Building Information Modelling (BIM), one of the latest tools in building design, based on parametric modelling paradigm, allow the collaborators to be in physically distant locations without face to face interaction. This amplifies complexity and need for improved design management. Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is an effective tool in managing iterative tasks such as design process. Parameter-based DSM represents design parameter relationships. This paper establishes that parameter-based DSM can be integrated with BIM, which also is parametric, for effective design management. Another obstacle in collaborative BIM is that different applications following different formats affect interoperability. Industry foundation Classes (IFC) is an open format developed as a solution to this. IFC is identified as suitable level in which the integration with DSM can be done.

AB With the help of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the digital catalogue of all the 44 components of Korean joinery system is developed for the application of their tectonic principles in the design of a transformable disaster shelter. Based upon the components of three primary bracket styles (Jusim-Po, Ik-Gong, and Da-Po) of traditional Korean joinery system in the catalogue, the parametric modifications of the components and their rearrangements are performed for various iteration of the disaster shelter. The usage of Korean joinery system in assembling and disassembling the components enhances the transformability and the reusability of the shelter. This paper demonstrates the computational implementation of Korean joinery system and the design process of a transformable disaster shelter.

AB The design of architecture, in practice, entails the collaboration of many disciplines each with their own set of tools and representations. Building Information Models aim to support interoperability between these disciplines. However current implementations require a lot of manual work involving translating parts from the various specialised descriptions to the common model format. Domain Specific Languages are a development from Information Technology that defines a mapping from the concepts used in one discipline to those used in another. In this paper, a workflow incorporating the movement between specialised languages and a central model is described. The central model is structured using the Industrial Foundation Classes (IFC). The motivation for elaborating on the interdisciplinary workflow is the desire to create a more iterative process without the need for the manual recreation of models. While it is difficult to have a description or language that contains all the information of all the disciplines, this research demonstrates how the IFC schema acts as a pivot not just between data sets, but also between concepts expressed in different representations thus giving from analysis to design.

AB The purpose of this study was to establish the contents and methods of a vocational education program for modern, advanced-level plasterers. This paper comprises six sections. The literature survey explored the contents and methods used in the conventional vocational education of plasterers. The interview survey confirmed that there is a serious shortage of vocational education resources available for advanced-level plasterers. The first questionnaire survey for seminar attendants, conducted in ten regional blocks nationwide, clarified the basic attributes of plasterers. The results of analysis, by multivariate statistical method (Hayashi's Quantification III) and cluster analysis, allowed plasterers to be grouped into eight types, and clarified the characteristics of each plasterer type as well as their relationships with each other when separated into the 10 regional blocks. In the follow-up survey, a questionnaire completed by plastering site supervisors was analyzed. This analysis facilitated a thorough understanding of the current work responsibilities of plastering site supervisors, and the types of vocational education that will be needed by advanced-level plasterers in the future. Regarding the training methods necessary for the vocational education of advanced-level plasterers, training types were broadly divided into on-the-job training(OJT) and off-the-job training(Off-JT) and then further sub-classified into 15 training types. Detailed vocational education contents were proposed for each sub-classification. Vocational education for plastering site supervisors trained through off-the-job training was implemented through a collaboration of the Japan Plasterers' Association and a university architecture department. The contents were described using a relational diagram. The results of the study were divided into the eight national types of plasterer mentioned above in order to facilitate vocational education for plastering site supervisors and advanced-level plasterers in accordance with the construction industry policy outline. In addition, the research results were used to establish and propose vocational education contents and methods based on the type of training required for each plasterer type.

DE Building Information Modelling; Industry adoption; Focused group
   interviews; Collaborative BIM Decision Framework
AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is one of the important areas in current Virtual Reality (VR) research. VR research considers not only the technological development, a very important part of the research also concerns the application of the technologies and their adoption by the practices. This paper firstly presents an analysis of the current state of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and a reassessment of its role and potential contribution in the near future. The paper analyses the readiness of the industry with respect to the (1) product, (2) processes and (3) people, to position BIM adoption in terms of current status and expectations across disciplines. The findings indicate that there were both technical and non-technical issues that need consideration. The evidence also suggests that there are varying levels of adoption and therefore the need for a specific tool to facilitate BIM adoption. The study revealed that even the market leaders who are early technology adopters in the Australian industry in many cases have varying degrees of practical experiential knowledge of BIM and hence at times different understandings and different levels of confidence regarding the future diffusion of BIM technology throughout the industry. There have been numerous factors affecting BIM adoption, which can be grouped into two main areas: technical tool functional requirements and needs, and non-technical strategic issues. There are varying levels of adoption and understanding within countries - from discipline to discipline and client to client. There are also varying levels of adoption from country to country and although many researchers and practitioners espouse collaborative working environments there are still challenges to be met in many parts of the world, particularly, in relation to a fully integrated collaborative multidisciplinary mode of operation. The challenges for the research community lie not only in addressing the technical solutions or addressing human centred issues but it is also in creating the enabling environment of a decision framework, which integrates both the technical and non-technical challenges. The need for guidance on where to start, what tools are available and how to work through the legal, procurement and cultural challenges was evidenced in the exploratory study. Therefore the Collaborative BIM Decision Framework has been initiated to facilitate the BIM adoption in the AEC industry, based upon these industry concerns, which consists of four interrelated key elements. The findings are drawn from a major research project funded by the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC-CI), with a focus on the Australian context.

AB Only very few constructed facilities today have a complete record of as-built information. Despite the growing use of Building Information Modelling and the improvement in as-built records, several more years will be required before guidelines that require as-built data modelling will be implemented for the majority of constructed facilities, and this will still not address the stock of existing buildings. A technical solution for scanning buildings and compiling Building Information Models is needed. However, this is a multidisciplinary problem, requiring expertise in scanning, computer vision and videogrammetry, machine learning, and parametric object modelling. This paper outlines the technical approach proposed by a consortium of researchers that has gathered to tackle the ambitious goal of automating as-built modelling as far as possible. The top level framework of the proposed solution is presented, and each process, input and output is explained, along with the steps needed to validate them Preliminary experiments on the earlier stages (i.e processes) of the framework proposed are conducted and results are shown; the work toward implementation of the remainder is ongoing (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Selecting an appropriate competition strategy in bidding is the ambition of most contractors. The multiple requirements of clients encourage contractors to consider other strategies to deliver additional benefits besides offering a low-price bid. Offering low bids will reduce contractors' profits and potentially make development less attractive. Contractors need to understand their specific resources that generate competitive advantage and accordingly develop strategies to win contracts. This paper reports the findings from a recent survey on competition strategies in the Hong Kong construction industry. Thirteen typical bidding strategies, their used frequency in bidding, and their effectiveness for winning contracts of different types and between different groups of contractors are studied. The analysis of findings is explored to provide local contractors and clients with new insights into competition strategies in bidding.

AB Cluster analysis of summer and winter discomfort in terms of heat and cold stresses based on 102-year (1901-2002) weather data in China was conducted. Five bioclimate zones were identified. These were compared with the corresponding thermal and solar zoning classifications. Bio-I and Bio-II tended to locate largely within severe cold and cold climates in the north with excellent solar availability (annual clearness index K-t generally exceeding 0.5). Bio-III and Bio-IV covered mostly the hot summer and cold winter and mild climate zones. Despite the relatively low K-t in winter, passive solar heating should be able to meet a significant proportion of the heating requirements. Bio-V covered the hot summer and warmer winter region, where heat stress and hence cooling requirement dominated. Decreasing trends in the zone-average annual cumulative cold stress during the 102-year period were observed for all five zones. There was, however, no distinct pattern for the heat stress and the changes tended to be more subtle. These indicate that climate change during the 20(th) century affected winter discomfort (especially in colder climates in the north) more than the summer discomfort. This could have significant implications for energy use in buildings if such trends persist. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The traditional fragmented nature of the construction industry along with the ad hoc matter in which investments in ICT have been made has resulted in a key cause of the poor performance and inefficiencies of the industry being attributed to the communication and exchange of information. The concept of Building Information Modelling (BIM) emerged to address the seamless exchange of information throughout the life of a facility following early modelling efforts focused on providing a solution to data exchange problems between several CAD and analysis systems. On the other hand. ICT supported collaborative teamwork has been an important aspect of building lifecycle management over the years in order to address the problems related to the fragmented nature of the industry. In parallel, recent studies in the field have demonstrated that BIMs will play an important role in facilitating collaboration. Most of the studies related to collaborative computing in construction have focused on facilitating the coordination and communication aspects of collaboration. In contrast, this paper proposes a system level and BIM-based approach for facilitating collaboration through the entire lifecycle of the building. In this context, the paper presents two design patterns that can be used as a foundation in formulating the design of information systems for BIM-based synchronous collaboration. The proposed patterns will help the system analysts/designers to focus on a system level picture when tackling recurring problems in the design of collaborative environments. Following a brief summary on the history of information modelling in the construction industry, this paper reviews the storage and exchange mechanisms of BIMs and then proposes two design patterns as a means to facilitating model-based synchronous collaboration.

AB There has been a demand for uniform CAD standards in the construction industry ever since the large-scale introduction of computer aided design systems in the late 1980s. While some standards have been widely adopted without much formal effort, other standards have failed to gain support even though considerable resources have been allocated for the purpose. Establishing a standard concerning building information modeling has been one particularly active area of industry development and scientific interest within recent years. In this paper, four different standards are discussed as cases: the IGES and DXF/DWG standards for representing the graphics in 2D drawings, the ISO 13567 standard for the structuring of building information on layers, and the IFC standard for building product models. Based on a literature study combined with two qualitative interview studies with domain experts, a process model is proposed to describe and interpret the contrasting histories of past CAD standardisation processes.

AB Most models of the incidence of occupational accidents in the construction industry are composed of multiple factors. Although statistical techniques can be used to infer cause-and-effect relationships among these factors, the large number of factors involved and the complexity of the relationships among them make it difficult for managers to identify potential hazards in construction projects and thus develop effective safety procedures. This study addresses this problem by using the association-rule method of data mining in performing an analysis of 1347 accidents in the Taiwan construction industry during the period 2000-2007. The association-rule method enables potential cause-and-effect relationships to be identified among the many factors that play a role in occupational accidents in the construction industry. The study finds that such accidents tend to occur when certain combinations of hazards are present - especially working in high places without protective measures, loss of balance when in motion, failure to use protective equipment, insufficient experience, and injurious contact with unstable structures. These hazards are especially evident in small enterprises with less than 10 persons. The results can help management to formulate effective safety policies with regard to management shortcomings and staff training. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the improved uptake of Building Information Modelling (BIM) new issues are emerging. Prime in these tasks is how it is presented to the various stakeholders, in tailor made views to reflect their demands and requirements. In this fragmented sector strong in the concept of phased handovers new methods of feedback loops need to be developed, and other stakeholders outside the procurement process need to be included to progress and manage the practice.
   Within this scenario is the role of the facility manager, who currently operates separately to the procurement stakeholders. Bridges need to be built to bring them closer together especially in light of life cycle costing and sustainability if the buildings operations and maintenance issues are to be addressed in the design phase. The model's ability to host work phases or stages opens up a method to co-inhabit the model to accommodate both sets of stakeholders.
   This filtering of the model has both tremendously positive aspects but conversely larger issues of ownership and custodianship have not to date been satisfactorily resolved. There is a major role for proper management here, which has not been appropriately identified. Initially there was a clarion call to architects to adopt this role and a few years ago this seemed to return the lead role to this noble profession.
   But patently they are neither prepared nor keen to take on this role. Constructing architects however do seem to want this discipline which can raise their profile and possibly lead to professional recognition and prestige.

DE text mining; classification clustering; methods; algorithm
AB Taking the features of data in low and high frequency texts and the frequencies which such features emerge in a single text into consideration, the paper sets up a vector space model for part of texts of field. Then the paper also establishes a classifying and clustering method with features of classification and clustering by designing and constructing the two-dimensional analytic indexes of similarities and differences between field texts. This method is designed for field texts because it is quite suitable for effective machine learning and can extend the text data and textual categories dynamically in real-time. Meantime, it solves the single-label classification and multi-label classification issues at one time, overcoming the defects of previous text classifying methods which can only expand data instead of capacity. The general text clustering methods have many defects: they are not suitable for high-dimensional data sets or large data sets; they don't have the text data and category expanding function and they can not handle the outlier data problem well. On the contrary, this new method can offer solutions to these defects. According to this method, the corresponding algorithm has been established and the effectiveness of the method has been proven by the experiment on the data sets of laws and regulations of construction industry in Shaanxi Province in China.

DE spatial modelling; relational model; computational topology; building
   information modelling
AB Motivated by research on how topology may be a helpful foundation for building information modelling, a relational database version of the notions of chain complex and chain complex morphism is defined and used for storing cw-complexes and their morphisms, hence instances of building projects and different views upon them, into relational databases. In many cases, this can be done without loss of topological information. The equivalence of categories between sets with binary relations and Alexandrov spaces is proven and used to incorporate the relational complexes into the more general setting of topological databases. For the latter, a topological version of a relational query language is defined by transferring the usual relational algebra operators into topological constructions. In the end, it is proven that such a topological version of relational algebra in general must be able to compute the transitive closure of a relation.

AB Data mining is the analysis of data from data-warehouse using series of mathematical and statistical methods to detect patterns. Such analysis derives important information which has proved the basis of accurate decision making in retail, banks, fraud detection, customer analysis etc. Construction Industry has benefited a little from these analytical tools mainly due to unavailability of work showing the application of these techniques in analysis of data in construction. A methodology to apply decision tree to analyze the construction labor productivity is presented in the paper. The methodology addresses three areas in decision tree construction process. These include selecting more influential attributes, combining multiple attributes and defining the threshold to ignore irrelevant attributes. The methodology gives more realistic results than the traditional method of decision tree.

AB In the wake of building information modelling, virtual reality is receiving attention for visualizing design details by means of virtual prototypes or virtual mock-ups. Examples for courthouse design review have prompted application to healthcare facilities. To facilitate perspective for patient-centred and evidence-based design, highly interactive, immersive virtual modelling is promoted to assist project stakeholders in validating design alternatives. This approach requires a significant database of model components to achieve timely turnaround of model concepts. The modelling of interactive elements (e. g. opening doors, folding beds) consumes more time than acceptable to the typical healthcare facility project team. The authors therefore are establishing a technology HUB to act as a central repository for object models shared by contributing partners. The HUB is intended to advance this approach and speed arrival to final product. The plan for this collaborative vehicle is described, as are issues relevant to partnering in this manner.

AB Cost estimation during early stage of a building construction project plays an important role for feasibility analysis in the planning and design phase. Traditional knowledge-based approaches suffer an essential difficulty due to resource price fluctuation in the market. This paper presents a hybrid method that integrates the principal items ratio estimation method with the adaptive neurofuzzy inference system for mining of cost estimation data. The proposed method provides exceptional capability for mining estimation knowledge that is difficult to be discovered by traditional knowledge-based approaches. A case study of residential building projects in China is conducted to demonstrate the proposed method. The testing results show that the proposed method does not only achieve high estimation accuracy, but also provide desirable features for estimators, such as explicit fuzzy decision rules and graphical presentations.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a detailed literature review of the recent applications of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP) group decision-making methodologies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Among more than 600 related papers published in the period 2005-2009, a total of 232 application articles published in highly reputed international academic journals were selected and referenced in this paper. Papers were categorized according to application areas, subject titles, publication date, country of origin, academic journals, and integrated methodologies, and are summarized herein by various tables and charts.
   Findings - The findings show that during the years 2005-2009, use of the AHP technique has continued to increase exponentially. Moreover, it is expected that ANP will gain more popularity in the future, as the benefits of ANP become better understood. Applications of AHP have been dominant in manufacturing, followed by the environmental management and agriculture field, power and energy industry, transportation industry, construction industry, and healthcare. Other remarkable application fields include education, logistics, e-business, IT, R&D, telecommunication industry, finance and banking, urban management, defense industry and military, government, marketing, tourism and leisure, archaeology, auditing, and the mining industry.
   Research limitations/implications - The study does not consider theoretical based AHP or ANP articles. Also the search excluded conference proceedings, masters' theses, and doctoral dissertations.
   Practical implications - It is hoped that this study will guide practitioners in future work towards advancement of these techniques and will help the managers to select better decisions by making use of these methodologies.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a comprehensive literature review of recent applications of ARP, and also ANP decision tools over the period 2005-2009. Furthermore, the paper covers fuzzy AHP and fuzzy ANP extensions that are becoming popular methods in some application areas of traditional AHP and ANP.

AB The result of the assessment of energy auditing of 100 public buildings made it possible to develop a new method which can function as a decision tool for retrofitting similar facilities. This article deals with the reduction of transmission heat losses because of the high investments of the building constructions. Building Information Modelling system plays a central role in the developed method. It is important to invest cost-effectively which can be measured by the payback of the investment. The order of the retrofitting was calculated with the help of Life Cycle Cost Analysis.

AB It is widely accepted that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) promotes efficiency in communication and as a result, brings increased effectiveness in the process of construction. It is inconceivable that today's large construction projects with the vast volume of information processed can be run at the necessary speed without using ICT. This is especially true in today's global context. However, we argue that in construction ICT is used mainly as mere enhancement tools, and not as means that can transform and thus revolutionize the process of construction. In this paper, we address this critical question: How is ICT impacting the process of construction and what are its potentials? We contend that the answer to this question lies in the integration potential of ICT.
   We conceptualize three aspects of integration - informational, organizational and contractual - as the basis to examine ICT's potential and illustrate this conceptualization by analysing two widely used technologies in construction, namely Building Information Modelling and datawarehousing. Our analysis, reveals that these technologies have features that can foster all three levels of integration. However, looking at the construction industry as a whole, we conclude that while informational integration has been achieved, the industry is far from achieving organizational and conctractual integration.

ID DESIGN
AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is expected to enable efficient collaboration, improved data integrity, distributed and flexible data sharing, intelligent documentation, and high-quality outcome, through enhanced performance analysis, and expedited multi-disciplinary planning and coordination. Despite these apparent benefits, the collaboration across the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) disciplines is largely based on the exchange of 2D drawings. This paper reports the findings from a research project that aims at developing measures to enhance BIM-based collaboration in the AEC industry. Based on focus group interviews with industry participants and case studies of BIM applications, visualisation was identified as an interactive platform across the design and non-design disciplines. It is argued that visualisation can enhance the motivation for BIM-based collaboration through integration of advanced visualisation techniques such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). An AR interface for a BIM server is also presented and discussed in the paper. AR can open up potential opportunities for exploring alternatives to data representation, organisation and interaction, supporting seamless collaboration in BIM.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been attracting much attention in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) for several years. BIM is a kind of 4D (or nD) design, in which architectural, structural, and facility design, cost estimation, and construction planning are integrated and done in a short period, employing a standardized product model named Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) developed by the BuildingSMART International. BIM has already been adopted for actual design and construction of a number of building projects worldwide. On the other hand, BIM has not been adopted in design and construction of civil infrastructures such as bridges, roads, tunnels, dams, river structures, compared to buildings, although some large general contractors have conducted earthwork and dam construction projects, employing 3D data. This paper addresses the issues such as why the infrastructure domain is slow in adopting BIM, whether BIM is really necessary and effective in the civil infrastructure domain, what the obstacles are in this domain. Then, the paper discusses and proposes how to implement BIM in the civil infrastructure domain.

ID COMPUTER-INTEGRATED CONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; COST
AB Recent advances in building information modelling (BIM) have actively disseminated the utilization of multi-dimensional (nD) CAD information in the construction industry. Utilizing advanced information technologies or instruments such as data acquisition technology (DAT), enterprise resource planning (ERP), computer integrated construction (CIC), or commerce at light speed (CALS) has also been rigorously implemented. Nevertheless, the concept of information systems (IS) in construction is very broad and subjective. Misunderstanding of these acronyms may result in confusions or mismanagement of resources. In order to enhance the communication with shared understanding, to integrate relevant concepts, and to identify effective areas for practical implementation, this study analyzed IS variables in the construction industry. The concept, history, and real-world cases for IS in construction were discussed by comparing two most often used acronyms; CIC and BIM. A comprehensive framework for IS frameworks in construction was then developed and analyzed. Lessons learned and implications are briefly summarized.

AB This paper reviews the technical features and requirements of Building Information Modelling (BIM)-servers as collaboration platforms for multi-disciplinary building and construction projects. Multi-disciplinary collaboration is the norm in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries, especially in complex projects. The widespread adoption of object-oriented Computer-aided Design (CAD) tools that support BIM capabilities has generated greater interest in model based exchange of information across disciplines and consultants who have traditionally collaborated through the frequent exchange of 2D drawings and documents. BIM-servers are collaboration platforms that are expected to provide the technical capability to support this inter-disciplinary exchange of 3D models in addition to intelligent management of the related drawings, documents and other forms of data. Since BIM-servers are a recent technical development a review of their technical features can help further development. This paper serves this objective by providing a review of the technical features and requirements for using BIM-servers as multi-disciplinary collaboration platforms on building and construction projects. The methodologies include focus group interviews (FGIs) with representatives from the diverse AEC disciplines, a case study on a state-of-the-art BIM-server, and a critical review and analysis of current collaboration platforms that are available to the AEC industries. This paper concludes that greater emphasis should be placed on supporting technical requirements to facilitate technology management and implementation across disciplines. Their implications for user-centric technology development in design and construction industry are also discussed.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is effective in order to build the environment where various information generated in a construction enterprise is used integrative. Although BIM is beginning to be used for a construction of architecture, there are few examples for a construction of a civil infrastructure. The proposal and use of a 3D product model which are the cores of BIM have just started. Therefore, the concrete example and application system of BIM are required. In this paper, the view of BIM is taken in the process of a construction enterprise not only including architecture but civil infrastructure, the information concerning a structure as a 3D-PDM and the application system was proposed. The 3D-PDM was proposed including temporal and spatial information. As a system which applied the 3D-PDM, a pedestrian traffic support system and the 3D GIS system for road maintenance are proposed.

AB An impressive progress in object-oriented and parametric modelling technologies was achieved over the past decade. This inter alia resulted from the development of dedicated information technologies for construction projects design. The construction industry is currently passing through a stage of historic changes linked with information databases. These changes are associated with the BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology. Fast-developing BIM technology opens up new possibilities in construction projects design as the market needs evolve.
   Academic world has also perceived that the application of this technology in education could both enrich the training process and contribute to the raising of the level of student's knowledge, which is instrumental for construction projects design. The Faculty of Civil Engineering of Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) has rolled out an academic curriculum, which includes the BIM technology and is based on Revit Architecture, a free graphic design system.

AB Since early 80's, any building that incorporates the latest technologies with automatically controlled systems has been considered as "intelligent". Nowadays, the influence of the emerging technologies in building design and construction is undeniable The main motivation for moving toward more intelligent systems\structures\buildings in building industry comes from increasing demands for comfort, flexibility, adaptability as well as the necessity for using natural resources more wisely The idea of the 'intelligent building' has achieved remarkable currency in the last few decades It has incorporated ideas related to self-adjustment and responsiveness in design principles which essentially has become possible by the advent of new technologies in various areas, particularly in the area of information technology.
   Technology and communication systems make it possible to combine several parameters by using system integration and computerization. Technology and computerized systems have enhanced and changed the manner of responses and provided a variety of decisions according to different sources of information This paper addresses the result of a research done by the authors on the evolution of kinetic intelligent architecture and its development and potentials By studying the development of kinetic intelligent buildings in recent years, we will show how intelligent systems can respond to ever-changing requirements of user's in terms of function, cultural and social aspects. This paper will also investigate how intelligent systems can help in redefining the new spaces and aesthetic concepts. The emergence of the application of responsiveness, adaptability thoughts in buildings will be explained.

AB Most construction companies are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that manage project-based and business-focused activities simultaneously. Commercial software packages are not fully developed to offer a unique solution that tackles both. To fill this gap, this paper describes an integrated management system specifically developed for SMEs in the construction industry, whether contractors or consulting engineering and architectural firms. Both, project and business functions are addressed and handled by the system as a whole. Particular attention is given to the procurement process because it is essential for the strategic planning of these companies, which must naturally engage new contracts to remain in business. The system is based on a client/server architecture that is arranged in three tiers: presentation (user interfaces and forms), application (queries), and data (relational tables). The system uses MS Access (TM) as a database management system. Users are categorized according to their functions within the hierarchy of the company, and therefore several different interfaces are designed for each personnel category. The system works in real-time, so every employee with a pre-established right of access can obtain information instantaneously. This is crucial for making immediate decisions when problems arise, allowing prompt actions from every manager in the hierarchy and resulting in noteworthy time savings. This computer-based application has been successfully implemented by four Spanish SMEs in the construction industry. The suitability and advantages of the system implementation are highlighted in this paper with specific data regarding its current operation.

AB Association rule mining is an important task in data mining. However, not all of the generated rules are interesting, and some unapparent rules may be ignored. We have introduced an "extracted probability" measure in this article. Using this measure, 3 models are presented to modify the confidence of rules. An efficient method based on the support-confidence framework is then developed to generate rules of interest. The adult dataset from the UCl machine learning repository and a database of occupational accidents are analyzed in this article. The analysis reveals that the proposed methods can effectively generate interesting rules from a variety of association rules. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an expansive knowledge domain within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry. To allow a systematic investigation of BIM's divergent fields, its knowledge components must be defined and expanding boundaries delineated. This paper explores some of the publicly available international guidelines and introduces the BIM Framework, a research and delivery foundation for industry stakeholders. This is a 'scene-setting' paper identifying many conceptual parts (fields, stages, steps and lenses), providing examples of their application and listing some of the Framework's deliverables. This paper also identifies and deploys visual knowledge models and a specialised ontology to represent domain concepts and their relations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of strategic group analysis is to determine whether clusters of firms that have a similar strategic position exist within an industry or not. Findings of strategic group analysis may further be used to investigate the performance implications of strategic group membership. The objective of this paper is to identify the possible strategic groups that could exist within the Turkish construction industry by using a theoretical framework applicable for the construction industry and alternative statistical cluster analysis techniques. The achieved results pinpoint the existence of three clusters and significant differences between the performances of firms in each cluster. All of the firms in the strategic group that have the highest average performance utilize a quality differentiation strategy and have the necessary resources and capabilities that give them the opportunity to differentiate their services from others. Also, they use a systematic approach and have a collaborative environment for strategic decision making. Findings of strategic group analysis can be used by professionals to understand the current strategic position of a firm within the competitive environment and formulate strategies to shift to a better performing cluster.

AB Due to the rising awareness of climate change and resulting building regulations worldwide, building designers increasingly have to consider the energy performance of their building designs. Currently, performance simulation is mostly executed after the design stage and thus not integrated into design decision-making. In order to evaluate the dependencies of performance criteria on form, material and technical systems, building performance assessment has to be seamlessly integrated into the design process. In this approach, the capability of building information models to store multi-disciplinary information is utilized to access parameters necessary for performance calculations. In addition to the calculation of energy balances, the concept of exergy is used to evaluate the quality of energy sources, resulting in a higher flexibility of measures to optimize a building design. A prototypical tool integrated into a building information modelling software is described, enabling instantaneous energy and exergy calculations and the graphical visualisation of the resulting performance indices.

AB In this paper we present a novel method to mine the correlations of events in sensor networks to extract correlation patterns of sensors' behaviors by using an unsupervised algorithm based on a hash table. The goal is to discover anomalous events in a large sensor network where its structure is unknown. Our algorithm enables users to select the correlation confidence level and only display the significant event correlations. Our experiment results show that it can discover significant event correlations in both continuous and discrete signals from heterogeneous sensor networks. The applications include smart building design and large network data mining

AB Financial crisis of construction companies not only influences the company itself, but also the shareholders, debtors, administration authorities, suppliers, employees, banks and the entire society. This paper employs artificial neural network of data mining and decision tree algorithm to build financial crisis warning model. The research results show that, forecasting performance of artificial neural network is better than that of decision tree model, hence, "financial statement average warning model" established through artificial neural network based on the average revenue of the past three years before financial crisis has better forecasting performance than the "annual report forecast model". Factor analysis is employed to select common factor in 1 year before financial crisis, and the critical variables of financial crisis are found to be: debt-to-equity ratio, quick ratio, borrowing dependence, inventory turnover ratio, and earnings per share. According to the decision tree rule, variables differentiable to financial crisis warning are debt-to-equity ratio, earnings per share, and borrowing dependence.

AB The development of building contractors in China is vital to the national economy. The level of operation and the competitiveness of the contractors would influence the development of the building industry. In accordance to the empirical analysis of the operation efficiency of the 85 contractors in Jiangsu Province, the results clearly describe the development level of building contractors. This analysis provides information to the Jiangsu government to formulate the regulations and policies to enhance the operation efficiency in the building industry. Current research is to analyze the situation of the Chinese building contractors in recent years and to investigate their operation levels whether have been met the requirements of the further development. The paper suggests an evaluation model to the supervision departments and construction market parties to evaluate and to improve the operation level of building contractors in construction market. The analysis and recommendations for improvement should be beneficial to the Chinese government and building contractors.

AB Value orientation, industrialisation of building processes, cradle-to-cradle design and remanufacturing are currently important themes in building process innovation. In the context of the Living Building Concept, these themes have been analysed and integrated in the Living Building Concept framework. Furthermore, implications of these concepts for building information modelling and construction ICT have been explored. Parametric design technologies seem to become more important than ever. On the other hand, cradle-to-cradle design and remanufacturing seem to require a life-cycle modelling approach based on the life-cycle of materials and components, instead of the usual approach based on the building life cycle.

AB Emerging Information and Communication Technologies offer major improvements to the practice of civil and building engineering. Techniques such as Building Information Modelling may substantially alter project design and management practices. Yet these systems are complex and are not easily adopted into current practice. This suggests that current work in civil and building information and communications technologies cannot achieve its full potential unless we also develop our practices for managing information on projects. Project Information Management is the practice of managing a civil or building engineering project's information systems, including its bodies of information, its information and communication technologies, and its related work practices. We contend that Project Information Management should be developed into a more formal and explicit sub-discipline of project management. In this paper, we will present suggestions for an overall framework for Project Information Management. We also describe the existing COBIT international standard for IT management and discuss its applicability for project information management for civil and building engineering.

AB The Real Estate and Construction Cluster is highly fragmented industry where most projects are based on low-bid contracts. This leads to ad-hoc project teams where most participants focus on minimizing costs and are not interested in developing new collaboration methods or adding value to other participants. However, all project participants have to collaborate and share information. This situation creates a significant challenge to companies who want to be in the leading edge. How far ahead of your competitors you can go? How to ensure communication with the other participants if your methods and tools are more advanced? How to build systems which can be used relatively independent of the business environment, but can also benefit from the information in the other systems used by advanced partners? This keynote will present the R&D strategy Olof Granlund has successfully used since the early 1990s to develop technical tools and business processes for integrated Building Information Modelling in the building services engineering and technical facility management.

AB This paper deals with the opportunities building information modelling (BIM) offers in supporting occupational safety in construction projects. The main focus is in BIM- based site layout planning and visualization. The paper demonstrates BIM-based site layout planning and the usability of the model. The main findings concerning the modelling tools available and the requirements for BIM-based site planning are also described. Additionally, the potential of 4D-simulation in safety planning is presented. The paper is grounded in the research project called SafetyBIM: Building Information Model (BIM) promoting safety in the construction site process. The main objective of the research project was to encourage and develop utilization of BIM technology in construction planning and management from the viewpoint of occupational safety. In the project, the potential of the building information model in safety management was studied, 3D site planning objects were collected and created, and BIM-based building site modelling and visualization tests were carried out using data from an completed building project. Additionally, the object library was tested and developed further in an ongoing BIM-based site planning pilot project. As a result, there is the first version of a site planning object library available for use in building projects. In addition, the needs, ideas and potential of BIM-based safety management were surveyed by workshops with industry representatives.
   Utilization of BIM technology connects safety more closely to construction planning, provides more illustrative site layout plans, effectively supports communication, and finally promotes occupational safety on building sites. From the viewpoint of occupational safety, the 4D production model enables visualization of safety arrangements in construction projects at different moments of time. This can be used for example in safety planning, day-to-day safety communications and managing changing situations. However, more experience and knowledge are needed concerning 4D safety simulation as well as further development of modelling tools such as object libraries to broaden the use of the BIM-based safety planning in the design-build process.

AB Urban renewal consists of various sub projects and thus it inherits the characteristics of mega projects. For this reason, this kind of project requires integrated management of sub construction projects. However, conventional project management system has limits to this end. In order to overcome those, various approaches and methods have been studied. A trend is to introduce IT technologies such as GIS, 3D/4D and Building Information Modeling (BIM) toward better performance by implementing IT-based collaboration. This research aims to analyze iPMIS development strategy in which efficiency of introduced IT can be validated using Strengths, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT) analysis.

AB Intelligent Buildings (IB) has not been adopted as quickly and widely as expected in China. One of the reasons for this is the lack of information and technology support to IB subsystem involved. This paper redefines the concept and connotation of IB, introduces the essential key element of the intelligent building (IB), analyzes the influence of ANN on the development of IB, elaborates on many subsystems of IB which are time-variant nonlinearity complex system, discusses the role of learning in IB control systems, and further analyzes the application of ANN in the construction of system model, designing control, and the intelligent air-conditioning. Based on the above issues, this paper constructs a system model of IB. Some applications of ANN technology and fuzzy control in IB and the design of intelligent controlling system are discussed. The proposed model will be helpful to solve the existing problems of intelligent building in construction industry.

AB The quality of human resource is crucial for construction companies to maintain competitive advantages in knowledge economy era. However, construction companies suffering from high turnover rates often rind it hard to recruit the right talents. In addition to conventional human resource management approaches, there is an urgent need to develop effective human resource management mechanism to attract and allocate the talents who are the most suitable to their own organizations in a construction company. In order to identify effective recruitment channels to access construction talents and design the appropriate screening criteria for selecting the right ones for different job functions, this study develop a data mining framework for human resource to explore the association rules between personnel characteristics and work behaviors, including work performance and retention. Case study demonstrated the practical viability of this approach.

AB In a competitive industry, effective performance management is an essential element of business success. However, despite their importance, performance management systems have not yet been widely implemented in construction companies. That said, many construction companies have become increasingly aware of the need to more systematically identify, implement, and sustain performance improvements in recent years. The objective of this paper is to develop benchmarking based performance management for construction contractors. This paper investigates examples of PMSs in the U.K., U.S., Brazil, and Chile and discusses the lessons learned. Then, to overcome the limitations of existing PMSs, a new performance measurement framework, in the form of a 'Construction' BSC, is presented. And a learning process using knowledge push is proposed. Finally, this paper develops a PMS for benchmarking in construction companies and recommends further areas of study for this research topic.

DE construction claims; integrated management; total elements cost
   management; the computing of claim amount
AB Construction claims, which involve multitudinous specialized disciplines such as engineering management, contract estimate, economy, public relationship and so on, are part of the most significant work in construction management, and they not only play the rolls of securing the rights of stake holders but also promote the comprehensive management level of construction companies, as well as their profits. In China, unlike the situation in the international construction market, due to the irregular operation of construction market, fierce competition among contractors, faint consciousnesses for claims and so forth, contractors do not utilize the lever of claim well enough. With the accelerating paces of internationalization in Chinese construction market and the emergence of the trend of integrated management in construction management, Chinese construction industry encounters unprecedented challenges and opportunities, which, at the same time, pose higher requirements for Chinese construction management. In order to accelerate the development of construction claim in China and enhance Chinese companies' international competitiveness, research on computing construction claims are necessary. Under this background and resting on the framework of total elements cost management theory, this paper discusses the importance of construction claims in the construction process as well as the problems of construction claims occurring in China. This paper also analyzes how to select the most appropriate methods, including network analysis method, dynamic analysis method and proportion computing method for time delay claims to computing claim amounts and fulfill the aim of integrated management. Some examples are also combined with these methods to manifest detail process of computing claims amount.

DE risk management hazards; contractors
AB To manage a company in a modern way means also to manage its risk. This refers to many aspects and activity areas thereof It's the construction and assembly production that requires a particular risk supervision in the construction companies. The risk relevant for building engineering ought to be identified with this very area, being all the threats that may potentially occur while executing any project. However, in practice, one may not get limited to the operating activities of these entities, but the risk management in a company also ought to comprise the investment and financial activities. Only such a formula ensures the comprehensive management of any threats in the activities of construction businesses. In Polish construction companies, no risk management systems have been implemented so far that would comprise all the areas and levels of these companies functioning. Also, there's no independent occupation of a risk manager in the Polish construction industry. Due to such innovations, it would be possible to limit the risk negative impact in a company. In particular, the operated system of the integrated risk management would allow for timely anticipation of some of the types of threats or for determining the most suitable manner of risk response. The risk management system operated within the company ought to be fully IT-supported. Owing to this, the risk managers will be able to acquire the current information on risk on regular basis, store it in the proper bases, process it, which will allow for counter-acting the risk in a more efficient manner in future as opposed to the common practice so far. By principle, each risk manager ought to possess the relevant knowledge about the potential threats in the company, so as to manage the risk effectively.
   The purpose of the publication is to discuss the selected issues on risk management in the activities of construction companies. In particular, the issue of implementing the comprehensive risk management system in the construction businesses is of top priority in the discourse. For the complex risk management requires the integrated management thereof

AB Occupational health and safety (OHS) in the construction industry are of grave concern around the world. Some construction firms have implemented their own safety management systems attempting to improve construction safety; however, the implementation of a new international standard: Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 is not commonly adopted in the industry. This paper examines the implementation of OHS management systems and the OHSAS 18001 in the construction industry. Questionnaire surveys and structured interviews were conducted. It is found that the OHS status in the construction industry is not satisfactory based oil data of recorded accidents from construction activities over the past three years. With regard to the operation of the OHSAS 18001 standard, it is suggested to integrate it with the ISO 9001 quality management system to streamline the process. Based oil the similarity and compatibility of the ISO 9001 and the OHSAS 18001, it is believed that an integrated management system could avoid duplication of effort and reduce resource inputs.

AB There is a higher rate of occupational injury in the construction industry than most other industries on average. However, steps can be taken to reduce worker risk through effective injury prevention strategies. In this article, association rule mining is employed in identifying the characteristics of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Accident reports during the period 1999-2004 are extracted from case reports of the Northern Region Inspection Office of the Council of Labor Affairs of Taiwan. In addition to general factors, several factors related to weather conditions are included in this article. The results show that there are. some patterns of occupational injuries in the construction industry. The effect of rain on the occurrence of fatalities is of great significance. Proposed inspection plans should be in accordance with the type of construction and environmental evaluation. The findings identified in this article provide a direction for more effective inspection strategies and injury prevention programs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although Data Mining (DM) has been applied extensively in information systems and identified as a crucial tool for automatic data analysis and enterprise knowledge inference, still the practicability of DM has been little explored in the construction industry in particular. This Study is conducted using data from actual practice in the customer service department of the target enterprise. Starting with data preparation, decision tree analysis and domain knowledge inference, practical verification is performed and previously unknown knowledge is discovered. Two practical barriers to enterprise information mining are found: the separation of information among various information systems and lack of key information attributes. Hence, there is a significant limitation on practical information data milling to generate new information, and only with a proper information integration one can benefit from the potential practical application of DM.

AB The goal of the single building information model has existed for at least 30 years and various standards have been published leading up to the 10-year development of the industry foundation classes. These have been initiatives from researchers, software developers and standards committees. Now large property owners are becoming aware of the benefits of moving IT tools from specific applications towards more comprehensive solutions. This study addresses the state of building information models and the conditions necessary for them to become more widely used. It is a qualitative study based on information from a number of international experts and has asked a series of questions about the feasibility of BIMs, the conditions necessary for their success, and the role of standards with particular reference to the IFCs.
   Some key statements were distilled from the diverse answers received and indicate that BIM solutions appear too complex for many and may need to be applied in limited areas initially. Standards are generally supported but not applied rigorously and a range of these are relevant to BIM. Benefits will depend upon the building procurement methods used and there should be special roles within the project team to manage information. Case studies are starting to appear and these could be used for publicity. The IFCs are rather oversold and their complexities should be hidden within simple-to-use software. Inevitably major questions remain and property owners may be the key to answering some of these. A framework for presenting standards, backed up by case studies of successful projects, is the solution proposed to provide better information on where particular BIM standards and solutions should be applied in building projects.

AB For studying urban thermal environmental phenomenon like heat island, numerical simulation can be an effective way. To carry out urban climate simulation, analyzing urban structure is needed and as it's possible to collect huge urban information by multifarious means in the present age, utilizing GIS which manages such information is a way of effective access when analyzing urban structure. Therefore this study aims at constructing EGIS DB of a coastal area Haeundae and performing statistical analysis for understanding urban structure and for ultimately accomplishing numerical Simulation. In this study, EGIS DB including building information database is constructed as a 200x200m mesh data and 8-type of representative areas are picked as a result of the Principal Component Analysis and the Cluster Analysis. On this base, thermal environment simulation of the summer day is carried out by UCSS (Urban Climate Simulation System) Box Model and the result is analyzed on the side of air temperature, humidity, wind velocity and heat budget.

AB The better the performance of a company, the more successful the company can be. The performance indicator of a construction company can be shown from its profitable, growth, sustainable, and competitive performance. However, to improve construction company performance in Indonesia, two main questions need to be answered: what are the construction company performance indicators as the success measuring tool and how many indicators will influence to create an ideal construction company business system. The use of survey method was the preferred method for answering these research questions. Analyses used in this research are statistical analysis and cluster analysis. The result of the research shows a firm relationship among the performance indicators. The company's performance quality is measured by the company's ability to grow and develop profit and technology implementation, ability to improve productivity and sustainability client satisfaction, and ability to have competent human resources.

AB Few factors that affect the company's successfulness are: internal, external factors, and market forces. External factors are factors that occurred outside the internal stakeholders. External factors commonly are dominated by government regulation which is giving legal aspect outside the monetary aspect, material ability, project safety, low cost competitors, money depreciation, technological changes, natural disasters, lack of material and worker. The research objective discussed in this paper is to identify the cause of the problems arise in a construction company's external factors that influence the company's success performance as a base to develop an ideal construction company business system in Indonesia. The methods used are literature studies and survey for identifying the cause of the problems and the performance indicators. Analyses used in this research are statistical analysis and cluster analysis. The results show the clusters from the problems arise in external factors that influence the construction company's performance.

AB Construction in general is characterized with project-based production. The construction supply chain is relatively fragmented, and the construction productivity is low and construction time and cost often overrun. Supply chain system is deemed an innovative and integrated management mode for resolving many problems from systems perspective in construction industry, and communication is the core issue to improve construction performance. This paper presents a systematic model of construction supply chain management integration enabling construction parties to improve communication performance. Construction project information is specified and illustrated for supply chain management, and then construction supply chain integration is modeled. Internet-based communication management and communication flow optimization for construction supply chain is suggested for improving construction performance and to accelerate the innovations in the construction industry.

AB The research develops a comprehensive assessment system of economic benefit of construction industry. The economic benefit of construction industry all over the country is analyzed and evaluated by factor analysis and cluster analysis. The consequence shows that there are great differentiations in all aspects of economic development level of construction industry among areas. Based on the result of cluster analysis, four groups are divided. The characteristics of the first group are great dimension, high level of technique and high working efficiency. The second are small scale, high level of technique and high working efficiency. The third are general scale, general level of technique and working efficiency. The characteristics of the fourth group are great dimension, technique and low working efficiency. In order to offer the development of construction industry of these areas some reference, according to these characteristics, some suggestions to improve the economic benefit of construction industry are put forward.

AB The construction industry has been facing a paradigm shift to (i) increase; productivity, efficiency, infrastructure value, quality and sustainability, (ii) reduce; lifecycle costs, lead times and duplications, via effective collaboration and communication of stakeholders in construction projects. Digital construction is a political initiative to address low productivity in the sector. This seeks to integrate processes throughout the entire lifecycle by utilising Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems. The focus is to create and reuse consistent digital information by the stakeholders throughout the lifecycle. However, implementation and use of BIM systems requires dramatic changes in the current business practices, bring new challenges for stakeholders e.g., the emerging knowledge and skill gap. This paper reviews and discusses the status of implementation of the BIM systems around the globe and their implications to the industry. Moreover, based on the lessons learnt, it will provide a guide to tackle these challenges and to facilitate successful transition towards utilizing BIM systems in construction projects.

DE Building Information Modelling; IPD; code checking
AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is only a tool in the procurement of a building, but it is changing the way the whole process is undertaken. Having a single model which is used by all disciplines requires a different management structure and by consequence a restructuring of the resources required to complete a project.
   These changes are encompassed in Integrated Practice and more recently Integrated Project Delivery, but professionals are not adopting them in great numbers. It appears that it is clients and code checking that will herald the changes, and that these catalysts will drive and impact the building industry in a greater role than previously thought.

AB This paper discusses the current state of building information modelling (BIM) from the structural point of view, incorporating the migration from 2D to 3D solutions. Open interfaces are also considered and how they provide access to BIM information away from the specialist modelling solutions to more conventional software tools, allowing closer design team collaboration. Two case studies are also highlighted to identify the benefits obtained from the structural BIM solution. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The continuous collection of data about the state of facilities appears increasingly feasible due to advances in sensing technologies. In this context, we explore the application of tag-based object location sensing to reconstruct models of existing buildings. We introduce the concept of tag-based building representations. Under certain conditions, these relatively unstructured representations are complete for the automated conversion to boundary-based building representations, which are useful for various construction-related applications. We describe solid modelling routines and spatial queries that facilitate the conversion from tag-based to boundary-based building representations. We provide a case study modelled in a system prototype to demonstrate how the conversion procedure works. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on a multi-disciplinary building design studio where a shared IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) building model was employed to support a collaborative design process in a teaching context. The paper discusses the background to the idea of design collaboration based on a shared building model, looking at both the nature of design decision-making, as well as the process opportunities afforded by close multi-disciplinary collaboration and rapid feedback through design analysis. The paper reflects on our experience in running an initial studio class in 2004 and, more recently, planning for a repeat studio in 2005, focussing on the operational issues that are encountered when working with a shared building model during a design process. The paper concludes with a statement of the lessons learnt and strategies to be adopted in future projects of this nature. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For the majority of design practices in the construction industry the use of CAD systems have been used to merely automate hand drafting (Cohen 2003). This is the traditional way of working that has changed very little since the introduction of commercial CAD systems. These practices as means of communication are being replaced by a virtual building model environment which encapsulates all of the information for an entire construction project and thereby enables computer-supported co-operative working practices. (Newton 2003) This study aims to determine whether Building Information Modelling (BIM) can, and whether it will, replace traditional communication media as the standard in the industry for computer-supported co-operative working practices in the Architecture Engineering and construction (AEC) sector. The bulk of the research comprises an extensive literature review looking at the principal reasons behind the development of BIM, the potential advantages and drawbacks of the technology, and the barriers and obstacles which inhibit its adoption as a means of computer-supported co-operative working. The findings of the study have been validated and analysed against current practice in the field through a live case study analysis of the on-going Heathrow airport Terminal 5 Project in London (UK). The Terminal 5 case study demonstrates that present software tools, although usable, still present significant implicit technical constraints to wider implementation among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The case study has also shown that in practice, the success of BIM depends just as much on the working practices and ethos of participants in the project chain as it does on the capabilities of the software itself, in particular the willingness of practitioners to change traditional working practices. The case study has shown that the present investment, in terms of time, cost, and effort required to implementing the technology means that BIM is unlikely to be adopted on small simple projects where conventional CAD is still adequate. It also highlighted that BIM tools currently available are not yet adequately developed to satisfy the requirements of the many procurement and especially contractual arrangements which presently exist and many firms will be frightened off by the unresolved legal issues which may arise from implementing BIM in their practices.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an emerging technology in the architecture/engineering/construction industry. This paper presents a case study of the implementation of BIM at the precontract stage of a small scale in-door swimming pool project in Hong Kong. It aims at reviewing the workflow between consultants and the impacts on design visualisation, drawing documentation and bills of quantities. A practicable approach to transform designers' traditional 2D drawings to BIM with the support from a BIM manager is unveiled. In addition to the results, this paper also highlights some issues such as hardware requirements, the shortfalls of the BIM tool and the supply and demand of skilled BIM personnel. There are other unanswered questions to be addressed in the near future.

AB This paper examines the meaning of information and communication technology (ICT) for architectural design in early design project phases, with a particular interest in building information modelling (BIM). Contemporary digital design environment, research context and objectives are first clarified, followed by the presentation and analysis of a few BIM-related projects. A key finding is that the architectural working environment, the design methods and the designer's roles have changed in the contemporary project context. Furthermore, other methods and tools are needed in addition to BIM in the early project phases, because it can not solve all required design aspects. [The presentation is part of the author's post-graduate studies in architectural BIM].

AB This paper reports a study that has been undertaken as part of an on-going project to examine the capacity of building information modelling (BIM) techniques to support collaborative design in the building industry. In particular, our premise is that effective design collaboration relies on the ability to exchange BIM data in a robust way using an open information standard such as IFC. The focus of this present work has been on the processes involved in design collaboration between architects and engineers responsible for advising on thermal performance issues. We begin by looking at the kinds of data that needs to be exchanged to support such collaboration. We then test the exchange using a pilot project model and finally review the capacity of the IFC standard to support such processes.

AB This paper presents a uniform model for high-rise structure design information and a case base containing 1008 high-rise buildings around the world. A case management system has been implemented with functions of data recording, modification, deletion, inquiry, statistical analysis and knowledge discovery. We propose a data-mining process of mining quantitative association rules for structure form selection from the case base and a method for mining fuzzy association rules. In the fuzzy association rule mining, we present a method for fuzzy interval division and fuzzification of quantitative attributes of the real cases. We demonstrate the application of the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules that can be used in building design. This data mining approach provides a new technical support for design efficiency, quality and intelligence.

AB Fire engineers use computer-based fire simulation models to determine the spread of fire and smoke; the response of a structure to high temperatures and the movement of people exiting from a building. The standardised Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) Building Product Model can be used to begin to achieve interoperability between electronic building descriptions created in commercially available Building Information Modelling (BIM) applications and fire simulation models.
   Two mainstream BIM applications, ArchiCAD and Revit, have been used to generate IFC compliant files that are translated by a parsing software tool into input files for two fire simulation models widely used by fire engineers, BRANZFIRE and FDS. The specific needs of fire simulation software means that a software tool has been developed to parse the IFC Model from the STEP physical file format to generate a subset of fire simulation related entities. This intermediate data is used by dedicated software interfaces developed to create specific input data for different fire simulation models (Figure 1).
   [GRAPHICS]
   The two fire simulation models employ distinctive conceptual representations of a building and differ in the way in which they carry out their computations. These differences significantly determine the requirements of the translation process from the IFC Model.
   The translation of geometrical and topological building information requires the identification of spaces, boundaries (walls and slabs) and openings (windows and doors) and their relationship to one another. Trial buildings have been used to test the ability to correctly interpret the IFC files and to determine where difficulties occur. A specific trial building is described here as an illustration of the capability of the current parsing tool.
   There are a number of challenges when using this approach for data sharing. There are limitations inherent in the IFC Model in describing buildings and fire engineering specific information where the structure of entities may not be compatible with the requirements of a particular fire simulation model. The representation of building spaces and elements can differ significantly with the various categories of models. This requires an ability to interpret and translate IFC Model entities to these alternate representations which adds to the complexity of the exchange process. Finally there are issues with the implementation of the IFC schema in commercial BIM applications and the capacity for users to populate IFC Model entities.
   The ability to quickly and accurately share building information created in BIM applications with fire simulation models has the potential to assist fire engineers during their design process. The IFC Model can be used to fulfil this role but there are a considerable number of obstacles that need to be tackled before then.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a new approach fo being able to describe and display the information required for design, construction and operation of buildings. More extended use of BIMS, with the development of Information Delivery Manuals (IDMs) for environmental assessments, energy calculations and LCC, ensuring more automatically data flow, between different data bases, calculation tools and Building Information Models (BIM), will simplify the use of LCC in design. More extended use of LCC, and storing the results for future use may also improve the Facility Management. Several projects have dealt with cost information flow, as information exchange between the BIM and LCC-tool and improving cost data bases, simplifying the data access as well as storage possibilities to ease and extend the use of LCCA. This paper will present the Current stage of file different project aiming at increased use of LCCA by use of BIM and IDMs.

AB The concept of public construction project is defined firstly. The contractual nature of public construction project is analyzed, and the concept model is set up. The difference is discussed between project supply chain and construction industry supply chain. It is put forward that the interface problems in project supply chain integrated management can be solved through virtual construction mode. Then the paper demonstrated that supply chain integrated management of public construction project would result in the emergence of Partnering mode.

AB The ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 were two fastest growing quality standards and were very popular since their establishment. In the construction industry, two ISO certificates are being issued independently. Companies often need to undertake two-separate audit processes in order to acquire both certifications. As a result, an Integrated Management System (IMS) which combining the ISO 9000 quality management system and ISO 14000 environmental management system is proposed as a management system for construction practice. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of IMS implementation in Hong Kong through the interview survey and a case study. This study found that the main strengths of the IMS include savings in time and cost; reducing resource allocating in paper work, manpower and administration and allowance for better arrangement in audit process. However, the way of management system integration is still pending to be sought as no guidance has been written down on the methodology of standards integration. This study suggests that the type of business, size of company, and resource allocation are the major reasons affecting the selection of different systems. The degree of systems integration is also varied depending on the companies' unique requirements and their particular business.

ID CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; SYSTEM; PREQUALIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Contractor prequalification involves the screening of contractors by a project owner to determine their competence to complete the project on time, within budget, and to expected quality standards. The process of prequalification involves a large number of contractors, each being represented by many attributes. A neural network model was applied to aid in the prequalification process by classifying contractors into groups based on similarity in performance using the financial ratios of liquidity, activity, profitability, and leverage. Contractors are represented in this model by patterns in four-dimensional space. Patterns of similar performance tend to form clusters intercepting regions of low pattern density in between. A neuron with weights is used as a classifier to set a decision boundary between clusters. The method basically iterates the neuron weights to move the decision boundary to a place of low pattern density. Then, the statistical hypothesis testing of the mean difference of two independent samples was used to validate the classification of the parent class to the two child classes considering the four ratios separately. The method was used hierarchically to classify a group of 245 contractors into classes of small numbers. Finally, the inferred procedure of classification proves that the neural network model classified the four-dimension pattern representing contractors efficiently.

AB Objective: The present study explores the discriminatory performance of existing and novel gold-standard-specific machine learning (GSS-ML) focused filter models (i.e., models built specifically for a retrieval task and a gold standard against which they ate evaluated) and compares their performance to citation count and impact factors, and non-specific machine learning (NS-ML) models (i.e., models built for a different task and/or different gold standard).
   Design: Three gold standard corpora were constructed using the SSOAB bibliography, the ACPJ-cited treatment articles, and the ACPJ-cited etiology articles. Citation counts and impact factors were obtained for each article. Support vector machine models were used to classify the articles using combinations of content, impact factors, and citation counts as predictors.
   Measurements: Discriminatory performance was estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and n-fold cross-validation.
   Results: For all three gold standards and tasks, GSS-ML filters outperformed citation count, impact factors, and NS-ML filters. Combinations of content with impact factor or citation count produced no or negligible improvements to the GSS machine learning filters.
   Conclusions: These experiments provide evidence that when building information retrieval filters focused on a retrieval task and corresponding gold standard, the filter models have to be built specifically for this task and gold standard. Under those conditions, machine learning filters outperform standard citation metrics. Furthermore, citation counts and impact factors add marginal value to discriminatory performance. Previous research that claimed better performance of citation metrics than machine learning in one of the corpora examined here is attributed to using machine learning filters built for a different gold standard and task.

AB Today, building information modelling (BIM) plays a crucial role in the research and development fields of construction information integration and interoperability. This paper, from an information technology point of view, outlines the definition and aims of the "3D to nD Modelling" project, a platform grant-funded project by UK's British Engineering and Physics Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). It presents a scenario of widening BIM implementation into the overall aspects involved in the whole life cycle of a building project. Industry foundation classes (IFC) as a standard BIM specification has been adopted as a central information repository in order to deliver the integrated building information throughout the nD-driven assessments, evaluation and decision-making. This paper also focuses on the development of an IFC-viewer, which is defined as the holistic interface of the nD modelling tool. The techniques and methods including the auxiliary tools adopted in this development are detailed. This development presents a practical and economic way to reveal and retrieve the information of IFC models inclusively, structurally and visually. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated the cost of inadequate interoperability within Property, Construction and Facility Management Industry at $15.8 billion per year. These costs were incurred by the capital facilities industry and represented between 1-2% of its cross-market revenue. Based on project lifecycle phases, the breakdown of these numbers revealed that the highest costs were incurred at the operations and maintenance phase directly followed by construction (NIST, 2004). According to the Institute, interoperability is "the ability to manage and communicate electronic product and project data between collaborating firms' and within individual companies' design, construction, maintenance, and business process systems." Interoperability and Building Information Modelling (BIM) are intrinsically linked. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a model-centric management system that "can capture, manage and present data in ways that are appropriate and customary for a particular designer, contractor, vendor or client" (Ibrahim et al., 2003). BIM is steadily gaining industrial acceptance as a replacement of documentation-centric Computer Aided Design (CAD). BIM has multiple representation protocols that are all facing similar barriers to adoption including: commercial, organisational and regulatory barriers (Drogemuller and Hampson, 2004). With the advent of the semantic web this paper questions the future and current shortcomings for Industry Foundation Classes. It also identifies (1) the value of interoperability to the industry and, (2) the key economic incentives for the adoption of Building information modeling. The model is then discussed with industry and business experts. Identification of relevant drivers and barriers for BIM adoption are discussed in relation with (Roger's 1995) Diffusion Model. Results are expected to assist the effective uptake of BIM.

AB Intelligent building, smart home, and home networking are hot topics in building industry. These systems rely on a physical layer to transmit signal. Wire and wireless physical layer are commonly used However, both layers have their limitations and associated problems especially in old building.
   In more than 20 year old public rental housing in HK, there is usually no spare cable containment for future cabling. Concrete chasing to install a new conduit in public corridor and tenant area is unavoidable for adding new network. In view of higher cost and great nuisance to the tenants during concrete chasing, an innovative use of building reinforced steel bars to transmit signals is introduced in this paper. The principle of signal transmission in reinforced steel bars is similar as signal coupling in a transformer. Signals are transmitted as magnetic flux by means of a transmission coil, which is installed through a reinforced steel bar. The magnetic flux flows all around the reinforced steel bars in the entire building. Another coil acting as receiver is installed in a remote area to receive the signals from the transmission coil. From the experiment, we proved that the idea is flexible. Signals can be received anywhere in the entire building with good performance.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Construction litigation has become commonplace in numerous construction projects particularly in large contracts. Miscommunication inadequate plans and specifications rigid contracts, changes in site conditions nonpayment, catch up profits limitations on manpower tools, and equipment, improper supervision notice requirements, constructive changes not recognized as such by owner delays and acceleration measures provoke claims and often result in disputes. A boosted decision tree system was used to predict the outcome of construction litigation. The study was conducted by using the same 114 Illinois court cases that were used in earlier prediction studies conducted with artificial neural networks in 1998 and case-based reasoning in 1999, augmented by an additional 18 cases that were filed in 1990-2000. All cases were extracted from the Westlaw on-line service. The best prediction result obtained with boosted decision trees was 90%. The boosted decision tree model appears to be a promising tool to help create a dispute-free construction industry.

AB The need for continual value innovation is driving supply chains to evolve from a pure transactional focus to leveraging interorganizational partner ships for sharing information and, ultimately, market knowledge creation. Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge. This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems. We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation. Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities.
   Through an exploratory field study conducted in the context of the RosettaNet consortium effort in the IT industry supply chain, we use cluster analysis to uncover and characterize five supply chain partnership configurations (collectors, connectors, crunchers, coercers, and collaborators). We compare their partner-enabled knowledge creation and operational efficiency, as well as the shortcomings in their capability platforms and the nature of information exchange. Through the characterization of each of the configurations, we are able to derive research propositions focused on enterprise absorptive capacity elements. These propositions provide insight into how partner-enabled market knowledge creation and operational efficiency can be affected, and highlight the interconnected roles of coordination information and rich information. The paper concludes by drawing implications for research and practice from the uncovering of these configurations and the resultant research propositions. It also highlights fertile opportunities for advances in research on knowledge management through the study of supply chain contexts and other interorganizational partnering arrangements.

AB Information extraction is concerned with applying natural language processing to automatically extract the essential details from text documents. A great disadvantage of current approaches is their intrinsic dependence to the application domain and the target language. Several machine learning techniques have been applied in order to facilitate the portability of the information extraction systems. This paper describes a general method for building an information extraction system using regular expressions along with supervised learning algorithms. In this method, the extraction decisions are lead by a set of classifiers instead of sophisticated linguistic analyses. The paper also shows a system called TOPO that allows to extract the information related with natural disasters from newspaper articles in Spanish language. Experimental results of this system indicate that the proposed method can be a practical solution for building information extraction systems reaching an F-measure as high as 72%.

ID COLLABORATIVE DESIGN
AB This paper reports on a multi-disciplinary building design Studio where a shared IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) building model was employed to support a collaborative design process in a studio-teaching environment. This project began with the premise that the efforts over the past decade of the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) to develop a genuinely operational building model schema has resulted in a mature technology that is now ready to be applied. This design studio experience sought to test that premise. The paper discusses the background to the idea of design collaboration based on a shared building model, placing this current work within that context. We look at both the nature of design decision-making, as well as the process opportunities afforded by close multi-disciplinary collaboration and rapid feedback fro design analysis. Although the work was undertaken in a teaching context, the paper does not discuss the pedagogical issue, but rather concentrates on the operational issues that are encountered when working with a shared building model during a design process. The paper concludes with a statement of the lessons learnt and strategies to be adopted in future projects of this nature.

AB Landmark-based navigation is the most natural concept for humans to navigate themselves through their environment. It is desirable to incorporate this concept into car and personal navigation systems, which are nowadays based on distance and turn instructions. In this paper, an approach to identify landmarks automatically using existing GIS databases is introduced. By means of data mining methods, building information of the digital cadastral map of Germany is analyzed in order to identify landmarks. In a second step, a digital surface model obtained by laser scanning is used to assess the visibility of landmarks for a given route.

AB As the result of the increase of households, which have a computer, the number of Internet users increased too. Greater throughput and permanent connection of a computer to the Internet enables the users to get more and more qualified services. The development of new Internet services and the use of the Internet to transmit important messages raise quite high requirements to the quality and reliability of the connection. As there is a high increase of Internet users, it is very important to predict the load of network during the network development. Some problems appear when there is a need to find the transfer rate of services that reaches the users through local network because network's throughput is divided to the users dynamically and the number of connected users, at the same time, always changes.

AB Accidents related to production, processing, storage and transportation of oil and its by-products have been studied extensively because of their social and environmental impacts. However, researchers have largely ignored accidents related to the construction of oil facilities, perhaps because such accidents involve a small group of people and result in smaller-scale environmental impacts.
   In this paper we discuss the major potential risks in every phase of an offshore unit construction. We identified the limitations of traditional safety management systems in coping with the critical problems related to safety issues.
   Many companies are using integrated management systems as the major tools to control risk. Such systems cover health, safety and environmental issues (HSE).
   PETROBRAS, the largest Brazilian oil company and one of the leading oil companies in the world, has adopted the HSE system. The system focuses on employee participation in implementation of the HSE system.
   We highlight leader commitment as one of the keys to good results. In many cases, management commitment is low, implying a need to convince them of the importance of health and safety performance to the future prosperity of their company.
   Contractual directives are baselines to build good relationships during the project. Another relevant point is to demand a management system like OHSAS 18001 from contractors. Awareness of health risks is generally below that of safety risks and emphasis should be placed on increasing understanding of the causes.

Based on the algorithm developed, BUILDS-C which is for the RC structural design program and one of subsystems in i-BUILDS (an intelligent BUILding Design System) has been developed. This optimum design algorithm, the structural behavior of beams and columns is implemented in the design sections of members satisfying code requirements are stored in the database and are manipulated by one major variable, i.e. the section identification number(N) linked with all other design variables. In design procedures, a continuous preliminary solution is obtained first, on the basis of regression curve equations, and then an effective direct search for the discrete optimum section is carried out. In advance, automatic design of walls, slabs and SRC columns for given design condition is followed.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the revised scaffold safety standard in the construction industry and to evaluate time trend analyses on scaffold-related fatalities and injuries, as well as inspections conducted and cited violations of the scaffold safety standard set forth in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 1926, Subpart L. Data on scaffold-related fatalities, injuries, and lost workdays, as well as cited violations of scaffold safety, were assembled from sources such as the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Integrated Management Information System, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data for the period prior to the revision of the standard were compared with data from the period after the revision. We used autoregressive analyses to evaluate the percentage of change in the mean scaffold-related fatalities, injuries and lost workdays and in the OSHA inspections and cited violations of scaffold safety. Effectiveness analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the revised scaffold safety standard in preventing fatal or nonfatal injuries in the construction industry. Complying with the revised scaffold safety standard would prevent approximately 4.6 fatalities, 404 nonfatal injuries, and 2896 lost workdays per year. A total cost savings associated with compliance was estimated at $5.8 million (2001 US$) per year. Compliance with the revised scaffold safety standard would provide a safer workplace and generate a significant cost saving in the construction industry. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The article deals with the computer aided design technology based on the concept of static graphical information modeling, which has the following goal: to ensure the succession of the building design, its construction process and project maintenance management; to ensure the integrated management of graphical and information data flows under a unified software environment; to perform life cycle operations of a construction project better, cheaper, and faster. While implementing this design the concept of the relation between a graphical - information model of a building and estimate calculations has been formulated; technique for classifying design elements and materials has been generated, necessary programming tools and data structures have been developed; integration of CAD OM and EP systems has been performed; technique for computer aided evaluation of economic indicators of a construction project has been composed, enabling to price a project (or its individual elements) interactively. For effective design, technological and organizational variants of construction projects the proposed method of synthesis has been selected, which provides a user with the clearly classified result, i.e. priority row of the variants synthesized.

AB One of the policies advanced earlier by the Ministry of Construction in China was to change the economic growth pattern of construction industry. Until now most of the evaluations on the construction growth have been based on qualitative and empiristic analysis. Few holistic and in-depth conclusions on it have been raised. This paper comprehensively presents the development of Chinese construction industry in nearly 50 years, based on the data of 6 variables relating to construction by the application of methods like factor analysis, stepwise regression and cluster analysis. Two factors are identified on which Chinese construction growth depends, i.e., the resource flow factor (RFF) and the resource input factor (RIF). However, RIF has always been highly relying on in the development of construction industry. Meanwhile the growth rate of construction industry fluctuated during the process of institutional change.

AB Real-time response to construction cost estimation request is crucial for firms to survive and grow in the construction industry. However, no existing construction cost estimating system fulfills this need thus far. This paper describes a joint effort by the academia and the industrial partner on developing such a system. Advanced web-based intelligence techniques are employed in the proposed system including WWW, neuro fuzzy system, and data mining. The industrial partner is in charge of providing knowledge sources, including expert judgments and historical data, for conceptual cost estimation. A Web-based Intelligent Cost Estimator (WICE) is resulted. The testing results show that the proposed system provides not only a globally accessible and promptly responding means for cost estimation, but also an effective and reliable tool for real-time decision-making.

AB Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is always a major concern in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. This paper presents the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology in the development of a lifecycle cost-estimating tool. The IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) model as an interoperable building information model has been adopted as the central data repository to deliver the integrated information of building designs from CAD design systems into the lifecycle-costing database. In this paper, the conceptions and relevant factors, which could affect the LCC estimation, have been introduced. The problems of current LCC applications have been identified as the lack of LCC data and the complexity of LCC exercises. The software application of IFC models and relevant auxiliary are depicted as a solution of the problem identified. The lifecycle costing tool is a part of the nD Modelling tool and as such is based on its integrated interface prototype toolkit and is able to holistically present an IFC model into a 3D virtual reality view, a tree-view and a list of element properties. The functions and some technical points are also detailed in the paper. Through the research, it demonstrates the potential and possibility of implementing BIM methods and techniques, particularly IFCs to enhance the computer applications in the processes of building construction and facility management.

AB A more intensive use of daylight, with a view to minimizing electricity consumption for lighting and reducing heating and cooling loads, has become an important strategy in the effort to improve the energy efficiency of non-residential buildings. Advances in artificial lighting technology are moreover leading to the use of light sources with higher luminous efficacy as well as more efficient lighting fixtures. A successful integration of the two lighting approaches through "intelligent" building design and control can lead to significant improvement of the users' visual comfort and amenity, while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact of buildings. An overview of recent progress in research and development in daylighting and artificial lighting technologies is given in this paper, with some emphasis on the integration of both lighting techniques by means of advanced building control strategies.

AB Quality has been a key issue in Singapore's construction industry since the late 1980s. ISO 9000 certification is now compulsory for large construction enterprises and is an important feature of the industry. Following the global trend, environmental issues are gaining prominence in the country. A few companies have been certified to the ISO 14000 standard. It is predicted that this standard will have an impact which is similar to that of ISO 9000. Organisations are being urged to implement integrated management systems (IMS).
   A study was undertaken to assess the perceptions and expectations of contractors concerning ISO 9000 certification and the costs and benefits in practice. Contractors' expectations of ISO 14000 certification were also ascertained, together with their environmental awareness, policies and current practices, and their views on measures which could promote its widespread adoption. The study was based on a postal survey. It was found that contractors had derived benefits from ISO 9000 but were driven by short-term cost-benefit considerations. Their attitude to ISO 14000 certification was generally similar. Suggestions for increasing the likelihood of a high uptake of ISO 14000, and IMS are made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The concept of competitive positioning is explored in the context of the United States construction industry along two dimensions-scope and mode of competition. The effects of competitive positioning on construction company performance are also explored while controlling the size of construction companies. Construction firms' choices regarding scope and mode of competition and their economic performance are self-reported. The statistical analyses used in this research include cluster analysis, Duncan multiple range tests, one-way analysis of variance, and one-way analysis of covariance. Research findings point out that construction companies address the challenges of the industry by adopting a number of competitive positioning alternatives. Research findings also reveal that construction companies' choices regarding scope and mode of competition are significantly related to company performance, measured by means of three criteria-profitability, growth in contract awards, and overall performance. Construction firms that place a strong emphasis on all modes of competition and adopt a neutral approach to scope of competition outperform their rivals.

AB The construction industry is experiencing explosive growth in its capability to, generate and collect data. Advances in data storage technology have allowed the transformation of an enormous amount of data into computerized database systems. Nowadays, there are many efforts to convert the large amounts of data into useful patterns or trends. Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) is a process that combines Data Mining (DM) techniques from machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to automatically extract concepts, interrelationships, and patterns of interest from a large database. By applying KDD and DM to the analysis of construction project data, this paper presents the results of a research that discovers the knowledge through KDD process to better identify recurring construction problems.

AB As the construction industry is adapting to new computer technologies in terms of hardware and software, computerized construction data are becoming increasingly available. The explosive growth of many business, government, and scientific databases has begun to far outpace our ability to interpret and digest the data. Such volumes of data clearly overwhelm the traditional methods of data analysis such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries. The traditional methods can create informative reports from data, but cannot analyze the contents of those reports, A significant need exists for a new generation of techniques and tools with the ability to automatically assist humans in analyzing the mountains of data for useful knowledge. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) are tools that allow identification of valid, useful, and previously unknown patterns so that the construction manager may analyze the large amount of construction project data. These technologies combine techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to automatically extract concepts, interrelationships, and patterns of interest from large databases. This paper presents the necessary steps such as (1) identification of problems, (2) data preparation, (3) data mining, (4) data analysis, and (5) refinement process required for the implementation of KDD. In order to test the feasibility of the proposed approach, a prototype of the KDD system was developed and tested with a construction management database, RMS (Resident Management System), provided by the U. S. Corps of Engineers. In this paper, the KDD process was applied to identify the cause(s) of construction activity delays. However, its possible applications can be extended to identify cause(s) of cost overrun and quality control/assurance among other construction problems. Predictable patterns may be revealed in construction data that were previously thought to be chaotic.

ID SELECTION; CRITERIA
AB It is widely accepted in construction management literature that superlative contractor selection criteria are: contractor ability to complete a project on time, within budgeted cost and to expected quality standards. Hence, contractor evaluation and selection models with the ability to highlight these attributes (i.e. help the selection decision) should be fully exploited. To date, such models have evolved based predominantly on multi-attribute analysis, case-based reasoning, and discriminant analysis, but there is scope for investigation of alternative strategies including: fuzzy set theory; neural networks; regression techniques; and cluster analysis. This paper concentrates an the latter by applying cluster analysis to real-life contractor selection data. Results indicate that the technique will simultaneously classify large numbers of contractors while identifying the most significant discriminating criteria among them. These characteristics offer potential for rationalization of contractor evaluation, classification and selection.

AB This article examines integrated computer systems for the construction industry-in particular for ''medium-sized'' contractors who are responsible for the bulk of construction activity. The main focus of the article is to evaluate the practical barriers, challenges, and opportunities facing the design and development of these computer-integrated construction systems, The article introduces a framework for thinking about computer-integrated construction in terms of distinct project views adopted by project participants as well as the computer applications used to support them, The article then addresses the practical organizational and computing context in which such systems must be used, describes the major areas of potential benefit offered by and barriers to integrated systems, and outlines three major design and development areas that should be addressed for future systems. Ln this last section, the article briefly introduces a number of projects carried out by the authors that address some of these design challenges and presents a road map for an ongoing research program for computer-integrated management tools for the construction industry.

ID SELECTION; CRITERIA; CHOICE
AB The essential task of prequalifying contractors most often involves a lar ge number of firms, each being represented by many disparate dimensions. Therefore, to effectively perform prequalification normally requires an inordinate amount of resource commitment by the construction owner. The statistical technique of cluster. analysis (CA) could aid this decision process by classifying contractor's into groups of like nature or common characteristics/ability. Further, the technique can identify the most discriminating criteria involved in achieving such classification and, thereby, help avoid subjective rejection of ''good'' firms, when large numbers of contractors are being considered. Example applications of the CA method are presented, in a construction contractor prequalification scenario. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI COMBINE - THE HVAC-DESIGN PROTOTYPE
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Integrated intelligent building design systems (IIBDSs) are computer-based design environments which will in the future be used by engineers and architects to assist them in the design of buildings. This paper deals with the class of IIBDSs whose aim it is to improve the energy efficiency and overall performance of buildings. Development of these IIBDSs is a substantial task and may take some time to be realized. The EC COMBINE project and the U.S. AEDOT project have been initiated to take the first step towards developing these future IIBDSs. This paper focuses on the COMBINE project.
   COMBINE's first step towards developing IIBDSs is to implement a building product model based on the 'product modelling' approach promoted by the computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) community. This building product model allows information about a building to be passed between different design professionals (e.g. architects, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers etc.). Data exchange through the product model is tested using various design prototypes one of which is called the HVAC-Design prototype. The HVAC-Design prototype helps a HVAC system designer to select a preliminary HVAC system for a building.
   This paper reviews: (a) ongoing research into the development of IIBDSs and (b) various software tools which may be incorporated into future IIBDSs. The main emphasis of the paper is on the COMBINE project and the functionality of the HVAC-Design prototype in COMBINE. There is also a discussion on how HVAC-Design may develop in the future.

AB The construction firm is incongruent in many ways with the usual manufacturing or service organization, and with some accepted precepts of strategic planning. In this study, the intended and realized competitive strategies of 170 firms in the Canadian construction industry are empirically derived through factor analysis and cluster analysis. The result is a taxonomy that resembles Porter's (1980) generic strategies.
